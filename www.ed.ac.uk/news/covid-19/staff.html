<p><span><span><span>Arcadia staff are working hard to contact all staff who use the Workplace Nursery Scheme. If you have not yet been contacted, please be patient. They will be in touch with you as soon as they can. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Key workers </strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are a key worker, as has been defined by the Scottish Government and the local authority in which the King's Buildings nursery sits, i.e. the City of Edinburgh Council, your child’s place remains available to you. However this will only be the case if there is no one else in your household who can safely care for your child. If there is, you must not send your child to the nursery. In which case you can opt to:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>put your payroll deductions on hold, or  </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>carry forward any credit balance you have in your account to use at a later date, or</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>have your balance refunded to you. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>These options will be discussed with you when you are contacted by Arcadia staff. Arcadia will notify Payroll of any change in time for the April pay-run. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are not a key worker you will be unable to send your child to nursery.  In which case you can opt to:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We recognise that some staff may unavoidably incur costs due to having to stay at home during the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, including doing as much as they can to work from home. Similarly, there will be costs that some staff will <strong>not</strong> incur, for example commuting to work. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For that reason, the University will exceptionally consider meeting the purchase cost of equipment or capability only where it is “wholly, exclusively and necessary” to homeworking and could not be supplied in advance by the University. Agreement to the purchase must have been made in advance by your line manager. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In order to claim this as a legitimate business expense, you will need to evidence that this equipment is wholly, exclusively and necessary for the claimant’s work purposes. There may be tax implications for the individual if they are not.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Common types of equipment that can be submitted as a working from home expense include:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Headphones with a microphone, up to a cost of £35</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Small IT-related equipment, for example a keyboard or mouse, up to a cost of £50</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Appropriate Display Screen Equipment (DSE) support including wrist rests (at a basic level unless specified for disability reasons) </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Other personal items not absolutely necessary to enable you to work from home cannot be claimed through business expenses. Non-compliant claims can result in expense payments being stopped or reclaimed from individuals.</span> <span>All items purchased through the expenses policy remain the property of the University and must be returned or the items will be subject to a tax liability to the individual as a personal item. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Staff can check if they are eligible for tax relief on working from home expenses by answering the questions on the <a href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/claim-tax-relief-expenses/this-service-has-been-reset">HMRC website</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Parking permits</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Current parking permits held by staff will be extended by the length of time that homeworking measures are in place.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In light of the additional restrictions on social contact and the ‘lock-down’ imposed by the Scottish Government, everyone, other than those who have been designated by the University as ‘essential workers’ is at home and, if they can work from home, doing the best they can.   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Therefore we only need you to tell us if you are self-isolating if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>you develop symptoms of the virus, or  </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>a member of your household has developed symptoms and you have been designated by the University as an ‘essential worker’.  </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In which case you should </span></span><span><span>follow the usual absence reporting procedure for your School/Department. You must call your line manager or the designated contact in your School/Department to report your need to self-isolate.  Please make sure you are familiar with the reporting arrangements within your School/Department and have to hand the correct contact details.   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are well enough, i.e. have very mild symptoms, your manager will agree with you if you can work from home. This will depend on your symptoms and the nature of your role and whether you have the equipment, access and approval to do so.  Working from home for the period of isolation will have <strong>no effect</strong> on your pay, which will continue to be paid as normal, and a record will be kept that you are self-isolating.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are unable to work from home for any or all of the period of isolation i.e. because you are too unwell or you don’t have the equipment, access or approval to do your job from home - your manager will place you on paid leave.  Your absence will not be recorded as ordinary sickness and will have <strong>no effect</strong> on your absence record or entitlement to sick pay.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are self-isolating because you are unwell:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>your absence will be treated as special sick leave</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>you will receive full pay for the period of absence related to the virus</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>your absence will have no effect on your absence record and entitlement to sick pay   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You must keep in regular contact with your manager, or the designated School/Department contact via email or telephone.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As you are advised not to visit your GP, you may not be able to obtain a Fit Note. In these circumstances, the University will not require you to provide a Fit Note for any Coronavirus-related absence of 14 days or less. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span>We appreciate that the Coronavirus outbreak will have impacted many holiday plans and that staff will be thinking of cancelling their leave to take at a later date.  However, in line with our Annual Leave Policy, it is important that staff have a regular break from work, even if this work is being done from home.  This is perhaps more critical to everyone’s health and wellbeing during this time of unprecedented and considerable change.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you were planning to be on leave during a normal school closure, e.g. over Easter, you should continue to take this from your annual leave entitlement.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have not already booked such time off, you should ideally consider doing so and discuss with your manager what impact, if any, </span></span></span><span><span>this would have on business critical activities/essential services.    </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the interest of your wellbeing, and our ability to return to on-campus working at some point later in the year, we would strongly encourage most staff to have taken between 40 and 60% of their total annual leave entitlement for 2020 before the start of the 2020/21 semester.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There is no need for anyone to request or record these days as annual leave days. We want to keep things simple and as administratively light as we can for all concerned.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The purpose of the two days of “collective annual leave” is for there to be a simultaneous ‘pause’ in our working lives.    </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Our Annual Leave Policy allows staff to carry forward up to 5 days annual leave into the next holiday year, pro-rated for staff who work part-weeks. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The UK Government has recently relaxed the Working Time Regulations to allow workers to carry forward up to 20 days’ leave into the next two holiday years and 8 days into the next year. The intent behind this change being to allow key workers – e.g. those in the NHS and other </span></span></span><span><span>industries, e.g. food distribution, critical to the Covid-19 effort – to carry forward some or all of the leave that it was not reasonably practicable for them to take due to the outbreak.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We very much hope that our designated essential workers (who have received an official letter to that effect to enable them to travel to and from work during the national ‘lock-down’) </span><span>will be able to take 40-60% of their leave over the coming months – and we will encourage and support them to do so for their health and wellbeing.

	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Keep connected.</span></strong><span> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Be mindful of assumptions about others</span></strong><span>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Stay healthy.</span></strong><span> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use, or cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span>As referenced in the above section on ‘Annual leave’, the University will effectively close on Friday 10 and Monday 13 April to enable everyone to switch off from work.  The purpose of this “collective annual leave” is to allow a simultaneous ‘pause’ in all of our working lives.    </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As we want to keep things simple and as administratively light as we can for all concerned - and everyone is continuing to be paid.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Staff do not need to ask for this time off; managers do not need to record these days as annual leave. This applies whether or not staff are able to work remotely.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>To ensure annual leave balances are correct however, staff who have already booked annual leave to cover Good Friday and Easter Monday should follow their normal School/Department arrangements and cancel their booking. They do not need to replace these with the rest day(s). If feasible, departments should look at how best to collectively remove pre-booked leave from their team records on behalf of individual staff. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>As these respite days are for staff currently in our employment, we won’t be adding the two days to the annual leave calculator. </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Staff designated as ‘essential workers’ (who will have received an official letter from the University to that effect to enable them to travel to and from work during the national ‘lock-down’) who are unable to take a break at this time will be able to take the time at a later date, ideally as a long weekend, as agreed with  their line-manager.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If any other member of staff is unable to take these days off due to business critical activities which cannot be postponed, they must agree with their line manager which days they will designate as respite days in the fortnight ending 24 April. Wherever possible, they should be encouraged to pattern this to give themselves a ‘long weekend’.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Staff who would not ordinarily work on a Monday or Friday – e.g. they work a part-week or compressed hours – will be able to designate other days in the weeks of 13 April and 20 April as their respite time. Wherever possible they too should be encouraged to take back-to-back days off.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Guaranteed hours (GH) staff scheduled to work on Friday 10 and Monday 13 April will be paid for the hours they were scheduled to work. If they are required to work, every effort should be made to provide equivalent respite in the following fortnight, i.e. by 24 April, when the same number of hours should again be processed for payment. If respite time is not feasible, e.g. because no work is available until later, or at all, the same number of hours as worked on 10 and 13 April should again be processed for payment.   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It’s important to consider the practicalities for your team working from home. It may be that staff have caring responsibilities or home environments that will make homeworking impractical.  Discuss the feasibility for working from home with each member of your team and make decisions on an individual basis. </span></span><a href="staff.html"><span><span>Guidance for staff</span></span></a><span><span> in relation to the University’s response to Coronavirus is publicly available and regularly updated. If there are any questions that you can’t find the answer here contact your </span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/contact"><span><span>HR team</span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Plan for home working by designing a simple contingency plan for your team. This should include all the key tasks/projects that are coming up for the next few weeks identifying key contacts including any suppliers, your proposed action and impact of this. It may be that it’s as simple as using the suggestions below to switch meetings onto Skype/Microsoft Teams but thinking about how you could do things in a different way or what you need to prioritise will be really helpful in making sure you can make quick decisions, know when things have happened and keep staff and students up to date about what’s happening.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Best practice for working at home:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Stay in regular contact with your team</span></span></strong><span><span> – Agree how you are going to communicate with your whole team; if not everyone is able to work from home consider a WhatsApp group or phone chain to relay key information. Start each day with a team huddle using Skype or Teams to check in with how everyone is doing, relay key information and discuss key focus/tasks for the day/week. Encourage your team to keep talking and checking in with each other as they would in the office. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Consider what is achievable</span></span></strong><span><span> – It may be that not everyone has access to everything that they would in their normal working environment. Establish ground rules with your team and be clear on deadlines and your expectations of them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span> Here are some questions to consider when planning work for the team:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What are the most critical tasks that need to continue? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Who is best placed to complete them? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there shorter-term deliverables that can be easily completed remotely? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there meetings/workshops/seminars that can take place remotely using the tools available? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What goals and limits can you ask your team to set themselves? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing - </span></span></strong><span><span><span>When people work from home, they run the risk of their home and work lives blurring into one. Associating home with work makes it a lot harder to switch off, and this stops people from relaxing, sleeping and can cause issues with their mental health.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To help:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage your team to plan and structure their working day and take regular breaks - without the distractions of the office and regular face to face meetings they may not be getting a break from their screen. The </span></span><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/vdubreaks.htm"><span><span>HSE</span></span></a><span><span> state that short, frequent breaks are more satisfactory than occasional, longer breaks: e.g. a 5-10 minute break after 50-60 minutes continuous screen and/or keyboard work is likely to be better than a 15 minute break every 2 hours. Encourage your team to take their lunch break away from screens.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage members of your team to set up working spaces in their homes. Not everyone has a spare room, but a corner with a desk that only gets used for working can help. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Talk to them about their concerns and what is going on for them personally. They may have additional caring responsibilities that they are needing to juggle whilst working. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regularly remind your team of the resources and support they can access remotely to support them: </span></span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/staff/health-wellbeing"><span><span><span>University of Edinburgh Wellbeing Resources</span></span></span></a>  </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Celebrate successes and thank your team regularly to help them feel appreciated for what they have achieved.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

For expense claims over £100, or where the claim was not authorised in advance, or the line manager is uncertain on whether the claim is necessary to home working, then they should consult with their local Finance or IT Manager before approving.

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Honouring Job Offers</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All job offers (verbal or written) will be honoured. Every effort will be made to ensure the best on-boarding and induction experience for new staff.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Recruitment Activity prior to Offer</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you are in the process of recruiting but have not yet reached offer stage, i.e. have already advertised the post and are actively long/short listing etc, you are encouraged to seriously consider the implications and practicalities of proceeding with an appointment at this time.   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Options may be to:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Pause – communicating with candidates that we will restart the process in 3-4 months.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Cancel – if there is the potential that resource needs might be changed as a consequence of the pandemic.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Complete appointment – if the appointment is business critical and you have confirmed that with your budget holder.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Recruitment not yet started</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you have a vacancy but have not yet advertised the post, it is likely that the pool of applicants will be significantly depleted, particularly if applicants would need to relocate to Edinburgh. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You should therefore seriously consider delaying what might not prove to be a productive exercise.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We should however progress business critical appointments that will support recovery post Covid-19. Line managers and the Main Budget Holders normal approval processes should be followed.</span></span>   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With traditional working arrangements rapidly changing due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus here is some guidance on how to support the induction of new staff when working remotely.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Speak to the member of staff as soon as possible before their start date to update them on the University’s guidance regarding <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 </a> and to answer any questions and concerns they may have. Discuss and agree how you will communicate with each other and the team.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Review the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/guidance-managers">Induction Guidance for Managers</a> to plan a successful induction considering how to adapt best practice for a remote working environment based on their role.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If it is possible for the staff member to work from home, review and discuss with them the Guidance for working from home on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 webpages</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills/digital-tools-remote-working/tools-remote-working">set up and work remotely</a>. They may not be familiar with the tools the University has for keeping in touch, give them plenty of time to get themselves set up and test connectivity. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Make them aware of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills">Digital Skills and Training</a> support available</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Discuss the set-up of their work environment, following the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/workplaces-general/homeworking">health and safety guidance</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Share the link to the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction">University’s induction pages</a> and ask them to review and complete the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/planning-own-induction">Making the most of your induction</a>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Work with your member of staff to plan the first couple of weeks of their working life at the University: what tasks do you expect them to complete and how will this work remotely? Who do you want them to speak to or meet with virtually?  Be clear about your expectations of them in terms of objectives, outputs and check-in points. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Over communicate – people are used to starting companies, meeting lots of people and being immersed into a social environment.  Schedule regular and frequent check-ins with them and make sure that they know how/when to get in touch with you. It’s important for new employees to become a functional part of the team; think about ways to remotely connect your new staff member with the rest of the team –this could be through virtual meetings, telephone conversations, shared projects. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing: starting a new role can be an exciting and daunting experience especially if they are not going to be based in their expected work environment. As with the rest of your team, follow the guidance for working from home<strong> </strong>and ensure that wellbeing is discussed in your regular check-ins.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Match them with a <a href="https://api.search.ed.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=edi-public-meta&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ed.ac.uk%2Ffiles%2Fatoms%2Ffiles%2Fbuddy_guidance_1.docx&amp;auth=luRwtAqLjQA2o34wvFialw&amp;profile=_default&amp;rank=1&amp;query=buddy">buddy</a> who can check in with them every day and answer any informal questions. If you have a team member who has experience of working remotely this is ideal.</span></span></span></li>
