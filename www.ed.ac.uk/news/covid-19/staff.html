<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of its response to the impact of Coronavirus (Covid-19) on the UK economy, the UK Government has implemented a temporary Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The Scheme is designed to help UK employers whose operations have been severely affected by Coronavirus and who consequently have no work for their employees. It helps them to retain and pay these employees rather than lay them off without pay or have to make them redundant.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Scheme currently allows employers to claim a grant from the UK Government to cover 80% of an employee’s pay, capped at £2,500 per month. The grant also covers the National Insurance contributions payable by the employer on this 80% or £2,500 and a minimal level of pension contributions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While the Scheme can be used by all types of employers, those who fund their employees’ salaries and wages from public funds, i.e. by funds received from the UK or Scottish Governments, are much less likely to receive payment. The Scheme will close on 31 October  2020. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note: changes to the Scheme were announced by the UK Chancellor on 27 May, to take effect from 1 July 2020. The implications of these changes for the University’s use of the scheme from this date will be reflected in these FAQs in due course. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>What does ‘furlough’ mean?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To access the UK Government’s Job Retention Scheme, an employer has to ‘furlough’ the employees for whom it has no work. This means to place them on temporary leave albeit with pay. Employees must be furloughed for a minimum of three consecutive weeks and must not carry out any work at all while they are on furlough.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</div>

<div aria-expanded="false" class="uoe-collapsible-featurebox panel-collapse collapse" id="uoe_featurebox_e8bf44f6181cd5cff4407fba35d962f48">
<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The University has decided that it will not access the Scheme for any member of staff whose salary is supported, in part or fully, by public funds, i.e. by funds received from the UK or Scottish Governments. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This means that it will <strong>not</strong> furlough any member of staff involved in the delivery of teaching, research or knowledge exchange activity, when those activities and support services are supported by NHS or UK Government grants or via the Scottish Funding Council, including the Research Excellence Grant. Such staff will continue to be paid as normal, with specific arrangements in place for those who are paid hourly, i.e. employed on Guaranteed Minimum Hours (GH) contracts. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> when the Scheme was first announced it was clear that posts funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) could not be furloughed as they are supported by public funds. We are, however, now able to furlough UKRI funded researchers who are unable to work remotely and have secured an unfunded extension to their UKRI funded- project by 10<sup>th</sup> June 2020.     </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will <strong>not </strong>furlough anyone who is designated as an essential University of Edinburgh worker, and who will already have received an official letter confirming this.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will furlough all other staff who are totally unable to work from home. While we can currently only claim back 80%, or £2,500 of an employee’s pay through the Scheme, <strong>we will continue to pay furloughed staff their full normal salary and contractual allowances</strong>. We will continue to deduct employee pension contributions as normal and to pay our employer contributions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Arcadia staff are working hard to contact all staff who use the Workplace Nursery Scheme. If you have not yet been contacted, please be patient. They will be in touch with you as soon as they can. </span></span></span></p>

However this will only be the case if there is no one else in your household who can safely care for your child. If there is, you must not send your child to the nursery.

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>put your payroll deductions on hold, or  </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>carry forward any credit balance you have in your account to use at a later date, or</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>We recognise that some staff may unavoidably incur costs due to having to stay at home during the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, including doing as much as they can to work from home. Similarly, there will be costs that some staff will <strong>not</strong> incur, for example commuting to work. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For that reason, the University will exceptionally consider meeting the purchase cost of equipment or capability only where it is “wholly, exclusively and necessary” to homeworking and could not be supplied in advance by the University. Agreement to the purchase must have been made in advance by your line manager. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In order to claim this as a legitimate business expense, you will need to evidence that this equipment is wholly, exclusively and necessary for the claimant’s work purposes. There may be tax implications for the individual if they are not.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Common types of equipment that can be submitted as a working from home expense include:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Headphones with a microphone, up to a cost of £35</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Small IT-related equipment, for example a keyboard or mouse, up to a cost of £50</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Appropriate Display Screen Equipment (DSE) support including wrist rests (at a basic level unless specified for disability reasons) </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Other personal items not absolutely necessary to enable you to work from home cannot be claimed through business expenses. Non-compliant claims can result in expense payments being stopped or reclaimed from individuals.</span> <span>All items purchased through the expenses policy remain the property of the University and must be returned or the items will be subject to a tax liability to the individual as a personal item. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Staff may be eligible for tax relief on some working from home expenses – this <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/covid-19_hmrc_tax_relief_on_homeworking_costs_6may2020.pdf">guidance document</a> provides further information.

<p><span><span>The position for current parking permit holders, who have paid in full for use of the University parking facilities in session 2020, but have not made full or any use of parking, is currently under review.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>All permit holders will be contacted directly in the coming weeks to advise how this will be resolved to ensure there is no financial impact for the period of closure.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Therefore we only need you to tell us if you are self-isolating if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are well enough, i.e. have very mild symptoms, your manager will agree with you if you can work from home. This will depend on your symptoms and the nature of your role and whether you have the equipment, access and approval to do so.  Working from home for the period of isolation will have <strong>no effect</strong> on your pay, which will continue to be paid as normal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are unable to work from home for any or all of the period of isolation i.e. because you are too unwell or you don’t have the equipment, access or approval to do your job from home - your manager will place you on paid leave.  Your absence will not be recorded as ordinary sickness and will have <strong>no effect</strong> on your absence record or entitlement to sick pay.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are self-isolating because you are unwell:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>your absence will be treated as special sick leave</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>your absence will have no effect on your absence record and entitlement to sick pay   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You must keep in regular contact with your manager, or the designated School/Department contact via email or telephone.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As you are advised not to visit your GP, you may not be able to obtain a Fit Note.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We appreciate that the Coronavirus outbreak will have impacted many holiday plans and that staff will be thinking of cancelling their leave to take at a later date.  However, in line with our Annual Leave Policy, it is important that staff have regular breaks from work, even if this work is being done from home.  This is perhaps more critical to everyone’s health and wellbeing during this time of unprecedented and considerable change.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It’s also important that we do not  return to on-campus working later in the year with a significant amount of annual leave still to be taken, potentially adversely impacting our adaptation and recovery plans. Therefore we would strongly encourage most staff to have taken between 40 and 60% of their accrued  annual leave entitlement  before mid-September 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We very much hope that there will still be ample time for staff to take all of their remaining leave entitlement once they are back at work and before the end of the current holiday year on 31 December 2020 (please refer to table below).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We will however keep this under review. This will include a review of our current annual leave policy which restricts carry forward of untaken leave to five days (pro-rated for part week staff).  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>On 18 June 2020, the Scottish Government confirmed that we had entered phase 2 of lockdown. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>At the moment access to campus for staff continues to be for ‘essential purpose’ only. Access to campus for ‘essential purpose’ will be managed by local management units who will confirm which of their staff can come on to campus for an ‘essential purpose’ which meets the criteria set out by Scottish Government. Local management units will retain a register of who has been approved to come on campus for an ‘essential purpose’ and will be responsible for making the necessary arrangements for individuals. This will include clear direction in the safety protocols which must be observed. This replaces the previous requirement to provide ‘essential worker’ letters to relevant staff and to maintain an institutional register of such staff. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>All identified essential staff must abide by the Government’s instructions. They must not come to work at all if they are in any of the vulnerable categories publicised or have any of the symptoms of Covid-19, no matter how mild.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Essential staff on site will abide by the following procedures to ensure their safety:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Rotas of a shorter duration have been introduced to maintain resilient teams</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A buddy system will be followed as outlined by the University – lone working is not allowed</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Social/physical distancing must be applied to all work activity, with a 2 metre minimum distance</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Staff should wash hands frequently and clean regularly touched points such as door handles and light switches </span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The following points outline the current steps that you should follow for remote and homeworking – we will let you know as soon as possible if this guidance changes:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>We are continuing to follow the UK Government’s <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults">latest advice on social distancing</a> </span><span><span>which states that if you <strong>can</strong> work from home, then you <strong>should</strong> work from home.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Some essential services will always be need to be delivered on campus. If you provide essential services which can only be delivered on campus, we are working with line managers to make every effort to reduce pressure in these areas.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Options to deliver your role through remote working must be discussed and agreed with your line manager. For guidance on remote working, please check the advice on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/off-site-working">IS website</a></span></span><span><span> and review it frequently as it will be updated.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are working from home, please ensure that you stay in regular contact with your line manager and colleagues – for work purposes of course, but also to retain regular social contact. Please take time to read the section on Health and Wellbeing </span></span><span><span>which focusses on working remotely. There is also a section below on Guidance for Managers on managing staff who work from home. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If managers need to gather information for contacting staff when working remotely, such as mobile phone numbers, they should be clear with staff on how this information will be used, who it will be shared with, how it will be held and not use it for any other purpose. </span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If your role can be done remotely, we do understand that you may be trying to do so while simultaneously caring for very young or disabled children, or supervising the home-schooling of older children. You may be doing this on your own and may also have other vulnerable or elderly dependants to care for.  If it is impossible for you to work from home due to your caring responsibilities, you should discuss this with your manager as you may be eligible for furlough, i.e. placed on temporary paid leave. More information on ‘furlough’ can be found above. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We know that what works for one member of staff working at home will not work for another. What worked in week one of the national lockdown may not work several weeks later, and we know that the needs of your household and dependants will change along the way, including as you perhaps move from home-schooling to what would have been school holidays.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>So there are no rules – it will be what works for you and we trust you to work that out and do what you can, when you can.  We’ll operate in the spirit of ‘best endeavors’. If you can work from home at some point in the day, we ask that you do so and that you do what you can to ensure your manager, your team and other key colleagues know when you are likely to be available. We understand that, with other members of the family at home, it may be difficult to predict when you will be available and that your availability to work may change at short notice. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you are requesting to, or being asked to return to, work on campus and you have one of the conditions listed in the <strong>higher risk group, </strong>you should contact your GP for advice on any additional specific measures which need to be </span></span><span>implemented to protect your health, as your GP has specific knowledge of your health. Please discuss any additional specific measures, as advised by your GP, with your line manager <span>so that appropriate consideration can be given to reasonable adjustments which may be necessary to protect your health.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Your manager may seek advice from the Occupational Health Service, via a management referral, if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Your GP is unable to provide advice</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You are unable to discuss your concerns with your line manager, or</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Either you or your manager require additional advice regarding your vulnerability to protect your health.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Thereafter, your manager will discuss with you any additional specific measures and/or adjustments, advised by your GP, which need to be implemented to protect your health and enable you to safely return to campus.  Your manager will discuss with you how to implement these where it is reasonable and appropriate to do to. This may include changes to work activities, practises or working patterns.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the additional measures / adjustments needed to protect your health are unable to be implemented, your manager will ask you to stay at home.  If you are unable to work on campus<strong> and</strong> you are unable to do your work from home then you will remain on a period of temporary paid leave. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You do not need to disclose medical <span>information to your manager, you just need to advise them that you are in one of the two vulnerable groups, and highlight any advice which you have been given by NHS / GP / Occupational Health to protect your health. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have prepared a Covid-19 staff assessment form which you can use if you feel it is helpful, </span><span>to let your manager know that you fall within one of the vulnerable </span><span>health </span><span>groups.  This form is not mandatory but available for those who wish to use it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Feeling overwhemed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Keep connected.</span></strong><span> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Be mindful of assumptions about others</span></strong><span>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Stay healthy.</span></strong><span> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff on guaranteed minimum hours (GH) contracts will be paid as below during the Coronavirus outbreak whether or not they are placed on furlough, i.e. temporary paid leave:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>April</span></span> </span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where staff have been allocated hours and are able to work from home (or on campus having been designated as an essential worker):</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>we will pay these allocated hours as normal, either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where staff have not been allocated hours, but would have expected to have been working were it not for Covid-19:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>we will reflect the formula embedded in the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means you will receive the higher amount of either a) the pay for April last year or b) the average pay in the 2019/20 tax year, and this will be paid at 100%. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>however, given the rapid transition to remote working, unfortunately we were not able to finalise these changes by the April payroll cut-off date.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>therefore, to ensure this group of staff are paid in April, we propose to re-pay the hours processed for payment in February 2020. We see this as fairer to staff, as it is a more representative month than March given the period of strike action which fell at the end of February and early March.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>we will however undertake a reconciliation and pay any shortfall in May. We will not recover any overpayment.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Staff who would not have been offered any hours in other circumstances will not be working and, as normal, will therefore not be paid. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>May onwards</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where staff have been allocated hours and are able to work from home (or on campus having been designated as an essential worker):</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>we will pay these allocated hours as normal, either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Where staff have been allocated and scheduled hours but are unable to work from home</span>:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>we will pay what was allocated/scheduled, </span><span>either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where staff have not been allocated hours, but would have expected to have been were it not for Covid-19:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>we will pay the higher of last May’s pay and the 2019/20 tax year average (again at 100%)</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>General information and summary of University approach</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As outlined in the staff FAQs above, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is designed to help businesses whose operations are directly and adversely impacted by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic to the extent that they have no work for some or all of their employees and consequently would have to lay them off or make them redundant. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The University has decided that it will not furlough staff who hold posts which are publicly funded, in full or in part. While there was originally  a degree of uncertainty regarding the approach being taken by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the University is now</span></span></span><span><span>, now able to furlough UKRI funded researchers who are unable to work remotely and have secured an unfunded extension to their UKRI funded- project by 10<sup>th</sup> June 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It has also decided to take a prudent approach to the inclusion of staff on fixed-term posts. While Government guidance suggests that staff on fixed-term contracts can be furloughed and their contract renewed during the period of furlough, in line with the underlying ethos of the Scheme, this should be directly attributable to the impact of Covid-19.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Consequently, fixed-term contracts will be renewed on a case by case basis, reflecting the business critical nature of the work involved. This will include where the role is critical to our Covid-19 recovery activity and/or existing plans which continue to be of strategic priority and for which there is budget. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Selection of staff to be placed on furlough    </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Heads of HR and HR Partners will work with senior managers to identify and agree which employees can be placed on furlough. If there is work for some but not all of the same role-holders, staff can be rotated on and off of work/furlough, provided they are each furloughed for a continuous period of three weeks. As in all matters, due consideration must be taken to ensure selection decisions are fair and do not discriminate against any cohort of staff. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once identified, proposals will be collated and presented to the Head of College/Professional Services Group for sign-off before being approved by the University’s Senior Leadership Team. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Decision making</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The starting point for all furlough decision making is whether there is any work a staff member can do while at home. If there is <strong>no work</strong>, the second key question is whether their salary is covered by public funds to any degree. If there is no work <strong>and</strong> <strong>their</strong> <strong>salary is not covered by public funds</strong>, then they can be furloughed. This ‘twin’ test also applies to staff who are shielding. Staff with caring responsibilities can be furloughed even if there is work for them to do, provided their salary is not publicly funded. </span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>I have staff on furlough and I need to return them to work. How do I do this?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In line with the rules of the CJRS, employees must be placed on furlough for a minimum of three consecutive weeks.  If for some reason you need to recall a staff member from furlough within the first three weeks, you must speak to your HR Advisor or Partner before doing so.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In all circumstances, the line manager or department manager should contact the member of staff and agree the date that furlough will end and when they will return to work.  Appropriate notice to allow for any caring responsibilities should be discussed and considered, as well as any concerns staff members may have.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To take the member of staff off of furlough, you must inform HR using the template which can be found <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms">here</a>.</span><span><span> Please ensure contact details are correct prior to sending to HR to avoid any delays.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>HR will then provide written confirmation to the email address provided previously, or by letter to the staff member’s home address if required.  The named manager will be copied in to the email sent to the colleague. Please note, this will normally be within 7 calendar days, unless otherwise advised.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Staff should not return to work from furlough without receiving this confirmation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>How do I place staff on furlough?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Managers must have the conversation directly with staff and agree the date that furlough will begin.<strong> In line with recently announced changes by the UK Government, this cannot be any later than 10<sup>th</sup> June 2020.</strong> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Your HR Advisor or Partner can support you with guidance for this conversation.</span></span></span></span> ​​​<span><span><span><span><span>Once this conversation has taken place, you will need to inform HR Services using the template <span><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms">here</a>.</span>  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>HR will then provide written confirmation to the email address provided. Please ensure contact details are checked with the staff member prior to sending to HR to avoid any delays.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>What is happening with staff currently on furlough until 30<sup>th</sup> June, will they be extended?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Staff can remain on furlough until 31<sup>st</sup> July 2020.  Although the CJRS will continue beyond this date, the rules are changing from 1<sup>st</sup> July and we are not currently clear what this will mean for the University.  As soon as we can, we will share more detail on the longer term for furlough.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Unless you tell us otherwise, your staff members currently on furlough will be automatically extended to 31<sup>st</sup> July 2020 by the HR department and confirmation will be sent to them directly.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>I need to bring staff back from furlough on the current end date of 30<sup>th</sup> June, what should I do?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You should follow the process for returning staff to work by having the conversation with the staff member, and agreeing an appropriate notice period and date to return.  You should then notify HR using the template <span><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms">here</a>.</span>  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note 1: The employee’s sickness due to coronavirus must not be recorded as normal sick leave. This is to ensure their absence is paid in full and that Covid-19 absence does not impact their sickness absence record or future entitlement to sick pay.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Note 2: This could be for 14 days if:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>a member of their household has symptoms/tested positive for the virus,</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>they have been advised to do so through close contact tracing; or </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>they are required to do so having entered the UK from overseas. </span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>The period of time could be considerably longer if they have been advised by their GP to take additional ‘shielding’ measures to protect their health. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: while ‘lockdown’ persists, there is no need to record that staff are on paid temporary leave because of caring responsibilities. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As referenced in the above section on ‘Annual leave’, the University  closed from Friday 10 to Monday 13 April to enable everyone currently at work to switch off from work. The purpose of this “collective annual leave” was to allow a simultaneous ‘pause’ in all of our working lives.    </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We want to keep things simple and as administratively light as we can for all concerned - and everyone is continuing to be paid.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Managers do not need to record these days as annual leave. This applies whether or not staff are able to work remotely.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>To ensure annual leave balances are correct however, staff who had already booked annual leave to cover Good Friday and Easter Monday should follow their normal School/Department arrangements and cancel their booking. They do not need to replace these with the rest day(s). If feasible, departments should look at how best to collectively remove pre-booked leave from their team records on behalf of individual staff. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>As these respite days were for staff currently in our employment, we won’t be adding the two days to the annual leave calculator. </span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Nor will be they be added for staff currently on long-term leave, e.g. maternity leave, sick leave.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Staff designated as ‘essential workers’ (who will have received an official letter from the University to that effect to enable them to travel to and from work during the national ‘lock-down’) who were unable to take a break at this time will be able to take the time at a later date, ideally as a long weekend, as agreed with their line-manager.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If any other member of staff was unable to take these days off due to business critical activities which could not be postponed, they must agree with their line manager which days they will designate as respite days in the fortnight ending 24 April. Wherever possible, they should be encouraged to pattern this to give themselves a ‘long weekend’.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Guaranteed hours (GH) staff scheduled to work on Friday 10 and Monday 13 April will be paid for the hours they were scheduled to work. If they were required to work, every effort should be made to provide equivalent respite in the following fortnight, i.e. by 24 April, when the same number of hours should again be processed for payment. If respite time is not feasible, e.g. because no work is available until later, or at all, the same number of hours as worked on 10 and 13 April should again be processed for payment.   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It’s important to consider the practicalities for your team working from home. It may be that staff have caring responsibilities or home environments that will make homeworking impractical </span></span>and so should be placed on temporary paid leave.​​​​​​<span><span>  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Discuss the feasibility for working from home with each member of your team and make decisions on an individual basis. </span></span><a href="staff.html"><span><span>Guidance for staff</span></span></a><span><span> in relation to the University’s response to Coronavirus is publicly available and regularly updated. If there are any questions that you can’t find the answer here contact your </span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/about"><span><span>HR team</span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Plan for home working by designing a simple contingency plan for your team. This should include all the key tasks/projects that are coming up for the next few weeks identifying key contacts including any suppliers, your proposed action and impact of this. It may be that it’s as simple as using the suggestions below to switch meetings onto Skype/Microsoft Teams but thinking about how you could do things in a different way or what you need to prioritise will be really helpful in making sure you can make quick decisions, know when things have happened and keep staff and students up to date about what’s happening.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Best practice for working at home:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Stay in regular contact with your team</span></span></strong><span><span> – Agree how you are going to communicate with your whole team; if not everyone is able to work from home consider a WhatsApp group or phone chain to relay key information. Start each day with a team huddle using Skype or Teams to check in with how everyone is doing, relay key information and discuss key focus/tasks for the day/week. Encourage your team to keep talking and checking in with each other as they would in the office. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Consider what is achievable</span></span></strong><span><span> – It may be that not everyone has access to everything that they would in their normal working environment. Establish ground rules with your team and be clear on deadlines and your expectations of them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span> Here are some questions to consider when planning work for the team:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What are the most critical tasks that need to continue? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Who is best placed to complete them? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there shorter-term deliverables that can be easily completed remotely? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there meetings/workshops/seminars that can take place remotely using the tools available? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What goals and limits can you ask your team to set themselves? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing - </span></span></strong><span><span><span>When people work from home, they run the risk of their home and work lives blurring into one. Associating home with work makes it a lot harder to switch off, and this stops people from relaxing, sleeping and can cause issues with their mental health.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To help:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage your team to plan and structure their working day and take regular breaks - without the distractions of the office and regular face to face meetings they may not be getting a break from their screen. The </span></span><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/vdubreaks.htm"><span><span>HSE</span></span></a><span><span> state that short, frequent breaks are more satisfactory than occasional, longer breaks: e.g. a 5-10 minute break after 50-60 minutes continuous screen and/or keyboard work is likely to be better than a 15 minute break every 2 hours. Encourage your team to take their lunch break away from screens.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage members of your team to set up working spaces in their homes. Not everyone has a spare room, but a corner with a desk that only gets used for working can help. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Talk to them about their concerns and what is going on for them personally. They may have additional caring responsibilities that they are needing to juggle whilst working. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regularly remind your team of the resources and support they can access remotely to support them: </span></span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/staff/health-wellbeing"><span><span><span>University of Edinburgh Wellbeing Resources</span></span></span></a>  </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Celebrate successes and thank your team regularly to help them feel appreciated for what they have achieved.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>It is highly likely that a number of your staff will be trying to work from home while simultaneously caring for their children and other dependants. Some will have support, others will not. Some will be sharing their home as a workplace, including IT. Consequently, they will not be, and cannot be expected to be, anywhere near as productive as they were on campus. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Managers must take all of this into account when assigning and following-up on work, and their staff can expect them to take a sympathetic, ‘best endeavours’ and flexible approach during these unprecedented times.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If adjustments to duties, priorities and deadlines, working hours and/or pattern (and a combination thereof) are insufficient in helping staff to do some work and care for their dependants, they must be placed on <strong>paid temporary leave</strong>. <span><span><span>Managers must seek advice from their HR Advisor on whether the staff member can be placed on ‘furlough’.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You must agree with your staff member how best to keep in touch with them while they are on leave. As and when the national restrictions ease, and the University re-opens its buildings, you should discuss with them how best they can return to work.    </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>To ease the administrative burden on all concerned, no flexible working requests need to be made or recorded. The temporary leave does not need to be recorded in the HR System or any local ‘absence’ recording systems. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All job offers (verbal or written) already made prior to our move to remote working should have been  honoured. Every effort must me l be made to ensure the best on-boarding and induction experience for new staff.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Recruitment Activity prior to Offer</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are in the process of recruiting but have not yet reached offer stage, i.e. have already advertised the post and are actively long/short listing etc, you are encouraged to seriously consider the implications and practicalities of proceeding with an appointment at this time.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Options may be to:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Pause – communicating with candidates to let them know when t the process will restart the process </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cancel – if there is the potential that resource needs might be changed as a consequence of the pandemic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Complete appointment – if the appointment is business critical and you have confirmed that with your budget holder.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Recruitment not yet started</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you have a vacancy but have not yet advertised the post, it is likely that the pool of applicants will be significantly depleted, particularly if applicants would need to relocate to Edinburgh. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You should therefore seriously consider delaying what might not prove to be a productive exercise.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We should however progress business critical appointments that will support recovery post Covid-19. Line managers and the Main Budget Holders normal approval processes should be followed.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Managers must not assume that non-UK nationals - unable to travel to the UK to take up their post - can work remotely, i.e. from their home country, or the country in which they are currently located.  Working overseas for a UK employer – even for a short period of time - can have immigration/work-permit, employment law, tax and social security implications (for both the individual and the University) in that third-country.

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Managers must therefore seek early advice from their HR Advisor to ensure appropriate specialist advice is obtained to inform such an agreement.  </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Please note that your new recruit will need to self-isolate for 14 days if they enter the UK on or after Monday 8th June 2020. You will therefore need to manage their induction remotely and decide if they can undertake any work from home.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With traditional working arrangements rapidly changing due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus here is some guidance on how to support the induction of new staff when working remotely.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Speak to the member of staff as soon as possible before their start date to update them on the University’s guidance regarding <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 </a> and to answer any questions and concerns they may have. Discuss and agree how you will communicate with each other and the team.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Review the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/guidance-managers">Induction Guidance for Managers</a> to plan a successful induction considering how to adapt best practice for a remote working environment based on their role.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If it is possible for the staff member to work from home, review and discuss with them the Guidance for working from home on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 webpages</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills/digital-tools-remote-working/tools-remote-working">set up and work remotely</a>. They may not be familiar with the tools the University has for keeping in touch, give them plenty of time to get themselves set up and test connectivity. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Make them aware of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills">Digital Skills and Training</a> support available</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Discuss the set-up of their work environment, following the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/workplaces-general/homeworking">health and safety guidance</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Share the link to the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction">University’s induction pages</a> and ask them to review and complete the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/planning-own-induction">Making the most of your induction</a>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Work with your member of staff to plan the first couple of weeks of their working life at the University: what tasks do you expect them to complete and how will this work remotely? Who do you want them to speak to or meet with virtually?  Be clear about your expectations of them in terms of objectives, outputs and check-in points. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Over communicate – people are used to starting companies, meeting lots of people and being immersed into a social environment.  Schedule regular and frequent check-ins with them and make sure that they know how/when to get in touch with you. It’s important for new employees to become a functional part of the team; think about ways to remotely connect your new staff member with the rest of the team –this could be through virtual meetings, telephone conversations, shared projects. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing: starting a new role can be an exciting and daunting experience especially if they are not going to be based in their expected work environment. As with the rest of your team, follow the guidance for working from home<strong> </strong>and ensure that wellbeing is discussed in your regular check-ins.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Match them with a <a href="https://api.search.ed.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=edi-public-meta&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ed.ac.uk%2Ffiles%2Fatoms%2Ffiles%2Fbuddy_guidance_1.docx&amp;auth=luRwtAqLjQA2o34wvFialw&amp;profile=_default&amp;rank=1&amp;query=buddy">buddy</a> who can check in with them every day and answer any informal questions. If you have a team member who has experience of working remotely this is ideal.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Consequently, until further notice, only successful applicants need be checked.   </span></span></span></span></span></p>
