<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The UK Government has implemented a temporary Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, <strong>which will end on 31 October 2020</strong>. The Scheme is designed to help UK employers whose operations have been severely affected by Coronavirus and who consequently have no work for their employees. It helps them to retain and pay these employees rather than lay them off without pay or have to make them redundant. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Scheme  allows employers to claim a grant from the UK Government to help them to pay furloughed employees 80% of their   pay, capped at £2,500 per month. With effect from 1 July 2020, employers can bring furloughed employees back to work on a part-time basis, and from 1 August the amount an employer can claim back from the UK Government will gradually reduce. From August, contribution towards employer’s national insurance and pension contributions will cease; in September employers can claim 70% of a furloughed employee’s pay (capped at £2187.50 per month) and in October it will be 60% (capped at £1875 per month).  This gradual reduction in the grant means employers gradually share more of the cost of keeping their employees on the payroll, hopefully at the same time as their business picks up. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> <strong>What does ‘furlough’ mean?</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To access the UK Government’s Job Retention Scheme, an employer has to ‘furlough’ the employees for whom it has no work. This means to place them on temporary leave albeit with pay. From 1 July, employees can return to work on a part-time basis and be on furlough for the remainder of their normal day/week. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The University has decided that it will not access the Scheme for any member of staff whose salary is supported, in part or fully, by public funds, i.e. by funds received from the UK or Scottish Governments.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This means that it will <strong>not</strong> furlough any member of staff involved in the delivery of teaching, research or knowledge exchange activity, when those activities and support services are supported by NHS or UK Government grants or via the Scottish Funding Council, including the Research Excellence Grant. Such staff will continue to be paid as normal, with specific arrangements in place for those who are paid hourly, i.e. employed on Guaranteed Minimum Hours (GH) contracts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> when the Scheme was first announced it was clear that posts funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) could not be furloughed as they are supported by public funds. We are, however, now able to furlough UKRI funded researchers who are unable to work remotely and have secured an unfunded extension to their UKRI funded- project by 10</span></span></span><sup><span><span><span>th</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span> June 2020.    </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will <strong>not </strong>furlough anyone who is designated as an essential University of Edinburgh worker, and who will already have received an official letter confirming this.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>From 1 July we can only continue to furlough those staff who had already been placed on furlough prior to 30<sup>th</sup> June 2020.  The only exception to this will be staff returning from maternity or other parental leave on or after 1 July 2020, and for whom there is no/little work. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>While the amount we can claim back from the scheme is less than an employee’s full pay, and will be reducing over the coming months, <strong>we will continue to pay furloughed staff their full normal salary and contractual allowances</strong>. We will continue to deduct employee pension contributions. Note: from 1 August 2020, specific arrangements apply to staff on guaranteed minimum hours (GH) contracts (please see below).<span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Permit holders who have paid for use of the University parking facilities between 1<sup>st</sup> April and 30<sup>th</sup> Jun 2020, but have not made full or any use of parking facilities throughout the period of lockdown closure have now been contacted and refunds have been arranged.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Going forward, all current City and King’s Buildings permit holders have been given three options:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>To cancel their full annual permits for the remaining months of the 2020 parking year </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>To switch to a pay-as-you go permit for the remainder of the 2020 parking year, to fit in with potential changes to working practices, </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>To continue with full annual permits, if that is still required.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span>Any decisions made for the remaining months of the 2020 parking year will have no impact on future parking applications made.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>New parking applications for those without a current full annual A or B pay-as-you go permit for City, King’s Buildings or Easter Bush, are now being accepted.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are well, i.e. do not have any or have very mild symptoms, your manager will agree with you if you can work from home. This will depend on your symptoms and the nature of your role and whether you have the equipment, access and approval to do so.  Working from home for the period of isolation will have <strong>no effect</strong> on your pay, which will continue to be paid as normal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We appreciate that the Coronavirus outbreak will have impacted many holiday plans and that staff will have cancelled  their leave to take at a later date.  However, in line with our Annual Leave Policy, it is important that staff have regular breaks from work, even if this work is being done from home.  This is perhaps more critical to everyone’s health and wellbeing during this time of unprecedented and considerable change.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It’s also important that we do not  return to on-campus working later in the year with a significant amount of annual leave still to be taken, potentially adversely impacting our adaptation and recovery plans. Therefore we would strongly encourage most staff to have taken between 40 and 60% of their accrued  annual leave entitlement  before mid-September 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We very much hope that there will still be ample time for staff to take all of their remaining leave entitlement once they are back at work and before the end of the current holiday year on 31 December 2020 (please refer to table below).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We will however keep this under review. This will include a review of our current annual leave policy which restricts carry forward of untaken leave to five days (pro-rated for part week staff). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff who have been furloughed will be required to take the equivalent of 2 weeks’ leave while they are on furlough. Staff do need to agree with their manager when they will be on annual leave as they do not have to remain contactable and available to return to work at short notice while on annual leave. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since 4 July, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/travel-advice-foreign-secreatary-statement-17-march-2020">advises British people against all non-essential travel worldwide</a><span>, apart from some exceptions. Full information can be found on the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control">UK Government website</a><span> with information specific to Scotland on the </span><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/">Scottish Government website</a><span>.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you do decide to go abroad you should:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>check the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice"><span><span><span>travel advice</span></span></span></a><span> about the country you are travelling to</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>be aware of any restrictions on your return to the UK, specifically if you will need to self-isolate at home for 14 days.   </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you will be travelling to a country which is not exempt from the government’s travel restrictions, you must let your manager know before you travel</span><span>. You must agree if your work can be done from home on your return and during the required 14-day isolation period. If, for any reason, your work cannot be done from home, you will have to cover the 14 days through taking:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>additional annual leave</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>unpaid leave</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>a combination of annual leave and unpaid leave. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you travelled to a country which has been removed from the list of countries exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement after you left the UK, you must contact your manager as soon as you can and agree how your self-isolation will be covered. If you can’t work from home, you will still need to make-up the working time you spent in isolation.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Please note that if you are on furlough and do go abroad to a non-exempt country you will also have to cover the 14-day isolation period with annual leave, accrued TOIL or take unpaid leave. This is to ensure the fair treatment of all staff who knowingly travel abroad when restrictions are in place and so limit their ability to work.    </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note: you do not need to self-isolate if a member of your household has returned from a country which is subject to travel restrictions. You only need to do so if they have symptoms of the virus or you have been contacted through the Test and Protect programme.    </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All on site staff must receive suitable and sufficient information to ensure they are aware of what extra measures have been put in place and how to safely access and navigate buildings they are returning to.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you are requesting to, or being asked to return to, work on campus and you have one of the conditions listed in the <strong>higher risk group, </strong>you should contact your GP for advice on any additional specific measures which need to be </span></span><span>implemented to protect your health, as your GP has specific knowledge of your health. Please discuss any additional specific measures, as advised by your GP, with your line manager <span>so that appropriate consideration can be given to reasonable adjustments which may be necessary to protect your health.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Your manager may seek advice from the Occupational Health Service, via a management referral, if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Either you or your manager require additional advice regarding your vulnerability to protect your health.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Thereafter, your manager will discuss with you any additional specific measures and/or adjustments, advised by your GP, which need to be implemented to protect your health and enable you to safely return to campus. Your manager will discuss with you how to implement these where it is reasonable and appropriate to do to. This may include changes to work activities, practises or working patterns.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the additional measures / adjustments needed to protect your health are unable to be implemented, your manager will ask you to stay at home. If you are unable to work on campus<strong> and</strong> you are unable to do your work from home then you will remain on a period of temporary paid leave. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You do not need to disclose medical <span>information to your manager, you just need to advise them that you are in one of the two vulnerable groups, and highlight any advice which you have been given by NHS / GP / Occupational Health to protect your health. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have prepared a Covid-19 staff assessment form which you can use if you feel it is helpful, </span><span>to let your manager know that you fall within one of the vulnerable </span><span>health </span><span>groups. This form is not mandatory but available for those who wish to use it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Keep connected.</span></strong><span> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Be mindful of assumptions about others</span></strong><span>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus. Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Stay healthy.</span></strong><span> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use, or cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>April</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where staff have been allocated hours and are able to work from home (or on campus having been designated as an essential worker):</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>we will pay these allocated hours as normal, either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where staff have not been allocated hours, but would have expected to have been working were it not for Covid-19:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>we will reflect the formula embedded in the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means you will receive the higher amount of either a) the pay for April last year or b) the average pay in the 2019/20 tax year, and this will be paid at 100%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>however, given the rapid transition to remote working, unfortunately we were not able to finalise these changes by the April payroll cut-off date.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>therefore, to ensure this group of staff are paid in April, we propose to re-pay the hours processed for payment in February 2020. We see this as fairer to staff, as it is a more representative month than March given the period of strike action which fell at the end of February and early March.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>we will however undertake a reconciliation and pay any shortfall in May. We will not recover any overpayment.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff who would not have been offered any hours in other circumstances will not be working and, as normal, will therefore not be paid.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>May, June and July   </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where staff have been allocated and scheduled hours but are unable to work from home:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>we will pay what was allocated/scheduled, either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Where staff have not been allocated hours, but would have expected to have been were it not for Covid-19:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>we will pay the higher of the pay in the same month last year  and the 2019/20 tax year average (again at 100%)/</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff who would not have been offered any hours in other circumstances will not be working and, as normal, will therefore not be paid.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>August</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>GH staff who would ordinarily have expected to work in August will be paid as follows:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>those who do work, whether at home or on campus, will be paid in line with the hours worked, either through e-time or normal departmental processing to payroll.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>those furloughed prior to 30<sup>th</sup> June will be paid in line with the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, i.e. the higher amount of a) the pay for August 2019 and b) the average pay in the 2019/20 tax year, and this will be paid at 100%</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>those for whom there is no work, but could not be furloughed prior to 30<sup>th</sup> June (e.g. because their salaries are already publicly funded) will be paid in line with the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, i.e. the higher amount of a) the pay for August 2019 and b) the average pay in the 2019/20 tax year, and this will be paid at 100%. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>GH staff who would not work in August in any other circumstance will not be paid.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>September and October</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Work is currently underway to refresh GH contracts for the new academic year.  Where work is available, staff will be paid in line with hours worked.  If no work is available, furloughed staff will remain on full paid leave until 31<sup>st</sup> October 2020.  It’s expected that those staff for whom there was no work between April and August – and who could not be furloughed as their salaries are already publicly funded – will be part of the GH contract refresh and paid in line with hours worked in September and October. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>GH staff who would not work in September or October in any other circumstance will not be paid.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</div>

<div aria-expanded="false" class="uoe-collapsible-featurebox panel-collapse collapse" id="uoe_featurebox_e04a5be34615deea30f26d29e78df18bd">

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>General information and summary of University approach</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As outlined in the staff FAQs above, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is designed to help businesses whose operations are directly and adversely impacted by the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic to the extent that they have no work for some or all of their employees and consequently would have to lay them off or make them redundant.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Since its introduction in March 2020, the scheme has been extended and modified.  It will now close on 31<sup>st</sup> October 2020. From 1 July, only employees returning from maternity or other parental leave can be furloughed for the first time. Employees who had been furloughed by 30<sup>th</sup> June can continue to be furloughed – either in full or in part, i.e. they can return to work on a part-time basis. The modified scheme is also referred to as ‘flexible furlough’ and from August 2020 the amount of grant which can be claimed will be gradually reduced.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While employers will receive less by way of government support. furloughed employees will continue to receive 80% of pay, capped at £2,500. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The University will top up the pay of its furloughed staff to 100% so that they receive their normal salary and contractual allowances. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Selection of staff to be placed on ‘flexible’ furlough </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Heads of HR and HR Partners will work with senior managers to identify and agree which furloughed employees will remain on furlough and for how long.  While some may remain on furlough through to 30<sup>th</sup> October 2020, it is hoped that, in line with the intent of the modified scheme, many staff will be able to gradually return to work to their normal contractual hours on an increasing basis.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>While the scheme allows employers to ‘flex’ the hours an employee can work and be on furlough on a weekly basis, the University has decided that work patterns will be determined on a monthly basis. This will significantly ease the administrative burden on managers, HR and Payroll in complying with the detailed recording, reporting and audit trail requirements laid down by HMRC who oversee the scheme.  The form for reporting furlough change requirements can be found <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms">here</a> </span></span><span><span><span>– and must be sent to HR before any changes can take effect.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As in all matters, due consideration must be taken to ensure selection decisions are fair and do not discriminate against any cohort of staff.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In all circumstances, the line manager or department manager should contact the member of staff and agree the date that furlough will end and when they will return to work.  Appropriate notice to allow for any caring responsibilities should be discussed and considered, as well as any concerns staff members may have. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>To take the member of staff off furlough, you must inform HR using the template which can be found </span></span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/a-to-z-of-forms"><span><span><span>here</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>. Please ensure contact details are correct prior to sending to HR to avoid any delays. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you will be returning the employee to work on a part-work/part-furlough basis, you will need to discuss this with the employee concerned and agree the hours and the pattern they will work.  The same template is used to send this information to HR.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>HR will then provide written confirmation to the email address provided previously, or by letter to the staff member’s home address if required.  The named manager will be copied in to the email sent to the colleague. Please note, this will normally be within 7 calendar days, unless otherwise advised.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff should not return to work from furlough – in full or in part - without receiving this confirmation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note 1: The employee’s sickness due to coronavirus must not be recorded as normal sick leave. This is to ensure their absence is paid in full and that Covid-19 absence does not impact their sickness absence record or future entitlement to sick pay.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note 2: This could be for 14 days if:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The period of time could be considerably longer if they have been advised by their GP to take additional ‘shielding’ measures to protect their health.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While government travel restrictions are in place, staff should let their managers know in advance if they will be re-entering the UK from a non-exempt country and so will have to self-isolate for 14 days on their return.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Managers should feel free to ask their staff if they will be travelling abroad and ensure they know if they will have to self-isolate for 14 days on their return.  If they do, managers should discuss how any work which cannot be done from home will be covered, such as onsite teaching or other on campus commitments.  If work cannot be done in part or in full from home, managers must agree how the time will be covered, i.e. through annual leave, accrued TOIL, unpaid leave, or combination thereof. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note: managers should take a sympathetic view if staff have travelled to a country which has been removed from the list of countries exempt from the 14-day self-isolation requirement after they left the UK. For example, Spain, which the Government announced on 25<sup>th</sup> July would be removed from the list at midnight on Sunday 26<sup>th</sup> July.  However, in fairness to all staff, if the staff member would be due to work on-campus on their return from holiday and they cannot work from home, they will still need to make up the working days spent in isolation.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Staff who continue to be furloughed, in full or in part, after 1 July 2020 are required to ‘use up’ 2 weeks (i.e. 70 hours, pro-rated for staff who work part-time) of their annual leave entitlement while on furlough. Staff do need to designate when they are on annual leave, as they do not need to be available for work and remain contactable as they do while on furlough leave.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You must agree with your staff member how best to keep in touch with them while they are on leave. As and when the national restrictions ease, and the University re-opens its buildings, you should discuss with them how best they can return to work.    </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>To ease the administrative burden on all concerned, no flexible working requests need to be made or recorded. The temporary leave does not need to be recorded in the HR System or any local ‘absence’ recording systems. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Honouring Job Offers </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All job offers (verbal or written) already made prior to our move to remote working in late March should have been  honoured. Every effort must be  made to ensure the best on-boarding and induction experience for new staff. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>General Recruitment Activity </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If you are in the process of recruiting but have not yet reached offer stage, i.e. have already advertised the post and are actively long/short listing etc, you are encouraged to seriously consider the implications and practicalities of proceeding with an appointment at this time.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Options may be to:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Pause – communicating with candidates to let them know when the process will restart Cancel – if there is the potential that resource needs might be changed as a consequence of the pandemic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Complete appointment – if the appointment is ‘mission critical’ and you have confirmed that with your budget holder.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Recruitment not yet started</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you have a vacancy but have not yet advertised the post, it is likely that the pool of applicants will be significantly depleted, particularly if applicants would need to relocate to Edinburgh.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You should therefore seriously consider delaying what might not prove to be a productive exercise. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>We should however progress mission  critical appointments that will support recovery post Covid-19. Line managers and the Main Budget Holders normal approval processes must  be followed.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>During the Coronavirus (Covid-19) situation, there are likely to be restrictions on a new recruit’s ability to travel to the UK to take up their post.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Managers <strong>must not assume</strong> that non-UK nationals - unable to travel to the UK to take up their post - can work remotely, i.e. from their home country, or the country in which they are currently located. Working overseas for a UK employer – even for a short period of time - can have immigration/work-permit, employment law, tax and social security implications (for both the individual and the University) in that third-country. These implications must be fully explored and risk assessed <strong>before</strong> any ‘home working’ agreement is put in place.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Managers must therefore seek early advice from their HR Advisor to ensure appropriate specialist advice is obtained to inform such an agreement.  </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please note that, from 10 July 2020, your new recruit will need to self-isolate for 14 days if they enter the UK from a country which is non-exempt from government travel restrictions. . </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>A list of exempt countries is available on the</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/pages/exemptions/">Scottish Government Website</a>.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You will therefore need to manage their induction remotely and decide if they can undertake any work from home. If they cannot work from home they will need to cover the 14-day isolation period through an agreed combination of annual leave and unpaid leave.  Advice must be sought in advance of agreeing this if the employee is a sponsored Tier 2 worker. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With traditional working arrangements rapidly changing due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus here is some guidance on how to support the induction of new staff when working remotely.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Speak to the member of staff as soon as possible before their start date to update them on the University’s guidance regarding <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 </a> and to answer any questions and concerns they may have. Discuss and agree how you will communicate with each other and the team.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Review the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/guidance-managers">Induction Guidance for Managers</a> to plan a successful induction considering how to adapt best practice for a remote working environment based on their role.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If it is possible for the staff member to work from home, review and discuss with them the Guidance for working from home on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 webpages</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills/digital-tools-remote-working/tools-remote-working">set up and work remotely</a>. They may not be familiar with the tools the University has for keeping in touch, give them plenty of time to get themselves set up and test connectivity. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Make them aware of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills">Digital Skills and Training</a> support available</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Discuss the set-up of their work environment, following the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/workplaces-general/homeworking">health and safety guidance</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Share the link to the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction">University’s induction pages</a> and ask them to review and complete the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/planning-own-induction">Making the most of your induction</a>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Work with your member of staff to plan the first couple of weeks of their working life at the University: what tasks do you expect them to complete and how will this work remotely? Who do you want them to speak to or meet with virtually? Be clear about your expectations of them in terms of objectives, outputs and check-in points. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Over communicate – people are used to starting companies, meeting lots of people and being immersed into a social environment. Schedule regular and frequent check-ins with them and make sure that they know how/when to get in touch with you. It’s important for new employees to become a functional part of the team; think about ways to remotely connect your new staff member with the rest of the team –this could be through virtual meetings, telephone conversations, shared projects. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing: starting a new role can be an exciting and daunting experience especially if they are not going to be based in their expected work environment. As with the rest of your team, follow the guidance for working from home<strong> </strong>and ensure that wellbeing is discussed in your regular check-ins.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Match them with a <a href="https://api.search.ed.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=edi-public-meta&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ed.ac.uk%2Ffiles%2Fatoms%2Ffiles%2Fbuddy_guidance_1.docx&amp;auth=luRwtAqLjQA2o34wvFialw&amp;profile=_default&amp;rank=1&amp;query=buddy">buddy</a> who can check in with them every day and answer any informal questions. If you have a team member who has experience of working remotely this is ideal.</span></span></span></li>
