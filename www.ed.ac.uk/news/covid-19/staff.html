It elaborates on our commitment that <strong>staff will not suffer any financial detriment </strong>due to the action the University needs to take to safeguard student, staff and visitor health and safety. Additional guidance is provided for managers. Staff are strongly encouraged to keep up to date by regularly reading the general information provided on the</span> <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 webpages</a> <span><span><span>and this section dedicated to staff and employment matters. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>In light of the additional restrictions on social contact and the ‘lock-down’ imposed by the Scottish Government, i.e. that everyone must stay at home, except for very limited purposes, we have revised our approach to leave and pay. As previously advised, and agreed with the joint trade unions, staff will not experience any financial detriment as a consequence of the actions the University has to take as a consequence of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. <strong>This means that all staff will be paid as normal</strong>.</p>

<p>As the vast majority of staff must now stay at home, with many caring for young/school age children, we no longer require staff to take emergency time off to care for their dependants. Nor do we need staff to report – or managers to record – that they are self-isolating due to a member of their household displaying coronavirus symptoms. We do however want and need to know if staff are themselves unwell.</p>

<p><strong>These Staff FAQs will be revised shortly to reflect these changes. We trust that anyone able to work from home will do so if and when they can, and we do not wish to add to everyone’s burden by unnecessary administration and record-keeping.  </strong></p>

<p>We recognise that some staff may unavoidably incur costs due to having to stay at home during the Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, including doing as much as they can to work from home. Similarly, there will be costs that some staff will <strong>not </strong>incur, for example commuting to work. </p>

<p>For that reason, the University will exceptionally consider meeting the purchase cost of equipment or capability only where it is “wholly, exclusively and necessary” to homeworking and could not be supplied in advance by the University. Agreement to the purchase must have been made in advance by your line manager. </p>

<p>In order to claim this as a legitimate business expense, you will need to evidence that this equipment is wholly, exclusively and necessary for the claimant’s work purposes. There may be tax implications for the individual if they are not.</p>

<p>Staff can check if they are eligible for tax relief on working from home expenses by answering the questions on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/claim-tax-relief-expenses/this-service-has-been-reset">HMRC website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Parking permits</strong></p>

<p>Current parking permits held by staff will be extended by the length of time that homeworking measures are in place. </p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We recognise that some staff may already be at home having been advised to self-isolate in line with previous Government and public health advice, i.e. due to having returned from a specified country. If you are, you should continue to self-isolate in line with the medical advice you received.  The below is based on the advice issued on 13<sup>th</sup> March 2020. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you or someone in your household has symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19) – i.e. a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature - you must self-isolate, i.e. stay at home, for:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>7 days</span></span></strong><span><span> from when your symptoms started <strong>if you live alone</strong>, or</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>7 days </span></span></strong><span><span>if you are the <strong>first</strong> in your household to develop symptoms, or</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>14 days if you live with others</span></span></strong><span><span> and you or they have symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>If you are the first in your household to develop symptoms:</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>you need to stay at home for 7 days from the day your symptoms start</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>everyone else in your household needs to stay at home for 14 days (from the day your symptoms start)</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>if someone in your household then develops symptoms</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>they need to self-isolate for 7 days from the onset of their symptoms. This could mean that they have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>The 14 day ‘whole household’ isolation does not restart each time a member of the household develops symptoms.   So you don’t need to self-isolate beyond 7 days – unless you continue to have a high temperature.  </span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>For example</span></strong><span>, you develop symptoms (day one). You have to stay at home for 7 days.  Everyone else has to stay at home for 14 days. If on day 10 your partner develops symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days – so in total they will have to self-isolate for 17 days. You don’t need to after day seven. No-one else needs to self-isolate after day 14, unless they too develop symptoms. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>If a member of your household is the first to develop symptoms:</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>they need to stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>you and everyone else in your household need to stay at home for 14 days </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>if you then develop symptoms</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>you need to self-isolate for 7 days from the onset of your symptoms. This could mean that you have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>The 14 day ‘whole household’ isolation does not restart when you develop symptoms.   </span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>For example</span></strong><span>, your partner develop symptoms (day one). They have to stay at home for 7 days. You and everyone else in your household has to stay at home for 14 days. If on day 10 you develop symptoms, you need to stay at home for 7 days – so in total you will have to self-isolate for 17 days. No-one else needs to self-isolate after day 14, unless they too develop symptoms. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You are<strong> </strong>not generally expected to work from home while caring for a dependant. However, during the Coronavirus outbreak, your manager will discuss with you whether it is feasible for you to work flexibly from home, in part or in full.   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We appreciate that you will be juggling many demands, including using and possibly sharing your home as a workplace, while simultaneously caring for young children and potentially trying to home-school your children at key times in their schooling. We know it will take some time to adjust to and establish any kind of rhythm and that what works for one member of staff working at home will not work for another. So there are no rules: it will be what works for you and we trust you to work that out and do what you can, when you can.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you can work from home at some point in the day, we ask that you do so if you can and that you do what you can to ensure your manager, your team and other key colleagues know when you are likely to be available. We understand that, with other members of the family at home, it may be difficult to predict when you will be available and that your availability to work may change at short notice. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If it is impossible for you to work from home, either because of your caring responsibilities or the nature of your role, you will be able to take 10 working days paid leave. This will be pro-rated for staff who work part weeks. <strong>Thereafter you will be on paid  leave – and be paid as normal. (PLEASE NOTE that this information was updated on 20 March to include “paid special leave”.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To slow the spread of the virus, on 16<sup>th</sup> March 2020 the UK Government advised the general public to restrict their social contact and stay at home as much as possible. In line with this advice the University decided to move to on-line teaching and assessment with effect from 23<sup>rd</sup> March and to transition as much as possible of its operations to be undertaken by staff working from home. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In all of our planning, our priority is always to ensure that key services for our students and staff continue to be provided in the most effective way and that you are supported as much as possible.  The health, safety and wellbeing of our students and staff will always be our top priority and will guide our decision making.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All Schools and Departments have business continuity plans in place which include an assessment of their business critical activities and what work can be done remotely, i.e. from home. This will recognise that there will be instances where some staff do need to come on campus for part of the week, but can work from home for the rest of the time. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We acknowledge that travelling to work might become difficult so will enable essential staff not already able to park on campus to do so. More information on this will follow.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Feeling overwhemed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Keep connected.</span></strong><span> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Be mindful of assumptions about others</span></strong><span>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Stay healthy.</span></strong><span> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use, or cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>You will also be entitled to Emergency Time off for Dependants, and will be paid for the hours you would have worked. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In line with the general guidance on working remotely/working from home, your manager will agree with you if this is at all feasible.  If you can do your work from home, you will be paid for the hours you are asked to work and these will be processed for payment in the normal way.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In line with the University’s 2019 agreement with UCU, teaching staff will be paid for any training they are required to undertake to move to on-line teaching and assessment. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you are well but unable to work from home for any reason (i.e. you are self-isolating, your work cannot be done from home, you do not have the equipment to work from home) your manager will consider if, with appropriate training, it would be reasonable to ask you to help with the essential services which must be maintained on campus.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If it is absolutely impossible for you to undertake any work, remotely or on campus, you will be placed on </span></span><strong><span>paid</span></strong><span><span> temporary leave.  Your manager will keep this under review as needs will change over the coming months and as we move to recovery.  </span></span></span></span>​​​​​​</p>

<p><span><span><span>We appreciate that the Coronavirus outbreak will have impacted many holiday plans and that staff will be thinking of cancelling their leave to take at a later date.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you wish to do this, you must discuss the need to do so with your manager.  In line with our <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/policies-guidance/a-to-z-of-policies-and-guidance">Annual Leave Policy</a>, </span><span>it is important that you have regular breaks from work, even if this work is being done from home. This is perhaps more critical to your health and wellbeing during this time of unprecedented and considerable change.   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Given the potential for extended nursery/school closures, if you were planning to be on leave during a normal school closure, e.g. over Easter, you should continue to take this from your annual leave entitlement.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have not already booked such time off, you should ideally consider doing so and discuss with your manager what impact, if any, this would have on business critical activities/essential services.    </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>In the interest of your wellbeing, and our ability to return to on-campus working at some point later in the year, we would expect most staff to have taken 40-60% of their total annual leave entitlement by the end of the current academic year, i.e. by 31 July 2020. </span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It’s important to consider the practicalities for your team working from home.  It may be that staff have caring responsibilities or home environments that will make homeworking impractical.  Discuss the feasibility for working from home with each member of your team and make decisions on an individual basis. </span></span><a href="staff.html"><span><span>Guidance for staff</span></span></a><span><span> in relation to the University’s response to Coronavirus is publicly available and regularly updated. If there are any questions that you can’t find the answer here contact your </span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/contact"><span><span>HR team</span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Plan for home working by designing a simple contingency plan for your team. This should include all the key tasks/projects that are coming up for the next few weeks identifying key contacts including any suppliers, your proposed action and impact of this. It may be that it’s as simple as using the suggestions below to switch meetings onto Skype/Microsoft Teams but thinking about how you could do things in a different way or what you need to prioritise will be really helpful in making sure you can make quick decisions, know when things have happened and keep staff and students up to date about what’s happening.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Best practice for working at home:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Stay in regular contact with your team</span></span></strong><span><span> – Agree how you are going to communicate with your whole team; if not everyone is able to work from home consider a WhatsApp group or phone chain to relay key information.  Start each day with a team huddle using Skype or Teams to check in with how everyone is doing, relay key information and discuss key focus/tasks for the day/week.  Encourage your team to keep talking and checking in with each other as they would in the office. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Consider what is achievable</span></span></strong><span><span> – It may be that not everyone has access to everything that they would in their normal working environment. Establish ground rules with your team and be clear on deadlines and your expectations of them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span> Here are some questions to consider when planning work for the team:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What are the most critical tasks that need to continue? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Who is best placed to complete them? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there shorter-term deliverables that can be easily completed remotely? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Are there meetings/workshops/seminars that can take place remotely using the tools available? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>What goals and limits can you ask your team to set themselves? </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing - </span></span></strong><span><span><span>When people work from home, they run the risk of their home and work lives blurring into one. Associating home with work makes it a lot harder to switch off, and this stops people from relaxing, sleeping and can cause issues with their mental health.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To help:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage your team to plan and structure their working day and take regular breaks - without the distractions of the office and regular face to face meetings they may not be getting a break from their screen. The </span></span><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/faqs/vdubreaks.htm"><span><span>HSE</span></span></a><span><span> state that short, frequent breaks are more satisfactory than occasional, longer breaks: e.g. a 5-10 minute break after 50-60 minutes continuous screen and/or keyboard work is likely to be better than a 15 minute break every 2 hours. Encourage your team to take their lunch break away from screens.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Encourage members of your team to set up working spaces in their homes. Not everyone has a spare room, but a corner with a desk that only gets used for working can help. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Talk to them about their concerns and what is going on for them personally. They may have additional caring responsibilities that they are needing to juggle whilst working. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regularly remind your team of the resources and support they can access remotely to support them. </span></span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/staff/health-wellbeing"><span><span><span>University of Edinburgh Wellbeing Resources</span></span></span></a>  </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Celebrate successes and thank your team regularly to help them feel appreciated for what they have achieved.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Honouring Job Offers</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All job offers (verbal or written) will be honoured. Every effort will be made to ensure the best on-boarding and induction experience for new staff.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Recruitment Activity prior to Offer</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you are in the process of recruiting but have not yet reached offer stage, i.e. have already advertised the post and are actively long/short listing etc, you are encouraged to seriously consider the implications and practicalities of proceeding with an appointment at this time.   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Options may be to:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Pause – communicating with candidates that we will restart the process in 3-4 months.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Cancel – if there is the potential that resource needs might be changed as a consequence of the pandemic.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Complete appointment – if the appointment is business critical and you have confirmed that with your budget holder.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Recruitment not yet started</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you have a vacancy but have not yet advertised the post, it is likely that the pool of applicants will be significantly depleted, particularly if applicants would need to relocate to Edinburgh. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You should therefore seriously consider delaying what might not prove to be a productive exercise.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We should however progress business critical appointments that will support recovery post Covid-19.  Line managers and the Main Budget Holders normal approval processes should be followed.</span></span>   </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With traditional working arrangements rapidly changing due to the impact of the Covid-19 virus here is some guidance on how to support the induction of new staff when working remotely.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Speak to the member of staff as soon as possible before their start date to update them on the University’s guidance regarding <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 </a> and to answer any questions and concerns they may have. Discuss and agree how you will communicate with each other and the team.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Review the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/guidance-managers">Induction Guidance for Managers</a> to plan a successful induction considering how to adapt best practice for a remote working environment based on their role.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If it is possible for the staff member to work from home, review and discuss with them the Guidance for working from home on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19 webpages</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them to <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills/digital-tools-remote-working/tools-remote-working">set up and work remotely</a>. They may not be familiar with the tools the University has for keeping in touch, give them plenty of time to get themselves set up and test connectivity. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Make them aware of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/is-skills">Digital Skills and Training</a> support available</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Discuss the set-up of their work environment, following the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/workplaces-general/homeworking">health and safety guidance</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Share the link to the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction">University’s induction pages</a> and ask them to review and complete the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/human-resources/learning-development/induction/planning-own-induction">Making the most of your induction</a>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Work with your member of staff to plan the first couple of weeks of their working life at the University: what tasks do you expect them to complete and how will this work remotely? Who do you want them to speak to or meet with virtually?  Be clear about your expectations of them in terms of objectives, outputs and check-in points. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Over communicate – people are used to starting companies, meeting lots of people and being immersed into a social environment.  Schedule regular and frequent check-ins with them and make sure that they know how/when to get in touch with you. It’s important for new employees to become a functional part of the team; think about ways to remotely connect your new staff member with the rest of the team –this could be through virtual meetings, telephone conversations, shared projects. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Support them as they manage their wellbeing: starting a new role can be an exciting and daunting experience especially if they are not going to be based in their expected work environment. As with the rest of your team, follow the guidance for working from home<strong> </strong>and ensure that wellbeing is discussed in your regular check-ins.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Match them with a <a href="https://api.search.ed.ac.uk/s/redirect?collection=edi-public-meta&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ed.ac.uk%2Ffiles%2Fatoms%2Ffiles%2Fbuddy_guidance_1.docx&amp;auth=luRwtAqLjQA2o34wvFialw&amp;profile=_default&amp;rank=1&amp;query=buddy">buddy</a> who can check in with them every day and answer any informal questions. If you have a team member who has experience of working remotely this is ideal.</span></span></span></li>
