<p>The University is pleased to announce financial support for students who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19</a>. This represents hardship funding we receive from the government and University funds. The funds can be used to cover any exceptional costs you may have incurred in relation to accommodation, subsistence, and travel. The financial support is available to matriculated UG, PGT, PGR students across fee statuses. Exceptionally, we will also make these funds available to those who graduate this summer and so you may apply at any time between now and 31 July 2020. </p>

<p>Visit the <a class="uoe-published uoe-node-link" data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-funding/financial-support/additional-financial-assistance/covid-19" title="Financial Support - Coronavirus (Covid-19)">student funding pages</a> to download the form and for further details. All forms and inquiries should be submitted to <a href="mailto:studentfunding@ed.ac.uk">studentfunding@ed.ac.uk</a>. The Scholarship and Student Funding team supported by other colleagues aim to process applications within 10 working days and will keep the webpages updated if the processing time extends. </p>

<p>The University will however not be offering compensation for tuition fees due to the outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19) as teaching for all taught students – undergraduate and postgraduate – is continuing, from 23 March 2020. It is, however, being delivered remotely from 23 March, with alternative assessments and online exams being introduced. </p>

<p>If you are unhappy, you can of course make a complaint at any time under the University’s Complaint Handling Procedure (CHP) – <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/university-secretary-group/complaint-handling-procedure/procedure">you can find more details about this online</a>. The CHP does not cover complaints which are requests for compensation only. </p>

<p><span><span>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Keep connected.</strong> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Be mindful of assumptions about others</strong>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Stay healthy.</strong> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></li>
	</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>As confirmed on 20 March, we exceptionally agreed to allow students early release from their fixed term leases as the University responded to Covid-19 with a transition from on-campus to remote teaching.   </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A 28-day notice period applies. Rent for that period is payable whether you are in residence during that time or not. This mirrors the tenancy conditions in private rented accommodation more generally. The University will not offer refunds for the notice period. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The University of Edinburgh was one of the first universities in the UK to offer a lease break to students.   </span></span></span></span>​​​​</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you wish to hand in your notice, please do so by email to the address below, including your name, address and matriculation number, in addition to your intended departure date which can be at any point in the notice period. If you have left but not yet removed your possessions, please arrange for a friend or neighbour to do so and confirm these arrangements in the email providing notice:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>On receipt of this email, an ACE colleague will provide further advice as to the departure processes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who have already handed in keys will be assumed to have triggered the lease break on 23 March 2020. If you have departed without returning your key, please let us know on the email address above.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
