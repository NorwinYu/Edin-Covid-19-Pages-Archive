<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span>We understand that many students have decided to return home. The University has decided to offer students the opportunity to terminate their accommodation lease with us if they wish.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Our student accommodation leases are normally fixed term, which means that there are no “break” points in the contract.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>However, given the exceptional circumstances, we will now allow students to break – or end – their accommodation lease with 28 days’ notice. This decision has been made with advice from the University’s Students’ Association and replicates private sector leases. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The window in which to notify the University that you would like to break your lease in student accommodation is from <strong>23 March until 31 March 2020</strong>. Your notice period will start on the day we receive your email requesting release from lease. Requests beyond this window cannot be considered.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Students will not be charged after their lease has ended.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you wish to hand in your notice, please do so by email to the address below, including your name, address and matriculation number, in addition to your intended departure date which can be at any point in the notice period. If you have left but not yet removed your possessions, please arrange for a friend or neighbour to do so and confirm these arrangements in the email providing notice:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a href="mailto:accomm.allocations@ed.ac.uk">accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk</a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>On receipt of this email, an ACE colleague will provide further advice as to the departure processes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Students who have already handed in keys will be assumed to have triggered the lease break on 23 March 2020. If you have departed without returning your key, please let us know on the email address above.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We will continue to support those students who remain in our accommodation and are happy to discuss any accommodation requirements should you require to stay in Edinburgh beyond your lease end.</span></span></span></p>

We will, however, be replacing traditional exams with “open book” exams or alternative assessments, as described above.

<p>With a move to remote teaching from the 23 March, students are not expected to attend timetabled activities or meetings with supervisors in person.  We will be taking the following approach to engagement and attendance monitoring for the remainder of the semester:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Undergraduate students should engage with the remote teaching provided by their School.  Results of assessments and exams will be recorded on your student record once marked.</li>
	<li>Postgraduate taught student engagement will be recorded through remote contact with your supervisor and dissertation hand in.</li>

<p><span><span><span>Provided you engage with your studies remotely, there will be no impact on your Tier 4 Visa.  We do recognise that not it may not be possible for all students to engage with their studies in this way; therefore if you will not be engaging with your studies remotely, you must inform your school and take an Authorised Interruption of Study.  </span></span></span></p>

<p>As a result of the UK and Scottish Government’s latest advice on social distancing, we are taking immediate steps to ensure that the health and safety of our students and frontline staff is protected as much as possible.</p>

<p>The Main Library in George Square will be closed from Monday 23rd March at 5pm, except for Counselling appointments due on Tuesday 24th March which will continue as planned.</p>

<p><span><span>We are extending loan periods during the closure and no fines will be accrued during this time. All loans – including standard loans, short loans and reserve – are renewed until 22nd June, after which we will review the situation.</span></span></p>

<p>For those of you who have appointments with Student Counselling later that week, they will be in touch with you directly. </p>

<p>We are looking into alternative provision of safe study spaces for those that need it, and will update you on this as soon as we can. </p>

<p><span><span>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Keep connected.</strong> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Be mindful of assumptions about others</strong>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Stay healthy.</strong> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you have symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19) – including those with a diagnosis of coronavirus (Covid-19) infection, who must remain at home until they are well – you should self-isolate </span></span><span>for 7 days from when your symptoms started.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The most common symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19) are recent onset of:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>new continuous cough and/or</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>high temperature</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For most people, coronavirus (Covid-19) will be a mild infection.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>if you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (Covid-19), however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>this action will help protect others in your community whilst you are infectious</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>stay at least 2 metres (about 3 steps) away from other people in your home whenever possible</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>sleep alone, if that is possible</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>stay away from vulnerable individuals such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions as much as possible</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you do not need to call NHS111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days contact </span><a href="https://111.nhs.uk/"><span>NHS 111 online</span></a><span>. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
