<p><span><span><span><span>As confirmed on 20 March, we exceptionally agreed to allow students early release from their fixed term leases as the University responded to Covid-19 with a transition from on-campus to remote teaching.   </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A 28-day notice period applies. Rent for that period is payable whether you are in residence during that time or not. This mirrors the tenancy conditions in private rented accommodation more generally. The University will not offer refunds for the notice period. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The University of Edinburgh was one of the first universities in the UK to offer a lease break to students.   </span></span></span></span>​​​​</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you wish to hand in your notice, please do so by email to the address below, including your name, address and matriculation number, in addition to your intended departure date which can be at any point in the notice period. If you have left but not yet removed your possessions, please arrange for a friend or neighbour to do so and confirm these arrangements in the email providing notice:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><a href="mailto:accomm.allocations@ed.ac.uk"><span>accom.allocations@ed.ac.uk</span></a></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who have already handed in keys will be assumed to have triggered the lease break on 23 March 2020. If you have departed without returning your key, please let us know on the email address above.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We feel very strongly that it is essential that assessment should continue, albeit some of it in an adapted form. This will not ignore the extraordinary circumstances we are in. The University’s approach to any major disruption to its operations is to minimise the impact on students while maintaining academic standards. It is important that you – and others, such as employers - can have confidence in your qualification; we do not think it would be helpful for the class of 2020 to be known as the class that graduated without doing their final exams. Also, many students were relying on their final exams to improve their course marks, or overall average, and we feel it would be unfair to deny you this opportunity altogether. We will, however, be replacing traditional exams with “open book” exams or alternative assessments, as described above. Boards of Examiners will be provided will information about the nature of the disruption that taken place during the past academic year and will be provided with guidance on how to reflect this disruption when they are considering course and programme results.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We recognise that during this uncertain time remote working is not easy. It is important to keep in regular contact with your supervisor or supervisory team. In addition, many Schools or research groups have set up social networks to help with keeping in touch. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Here are some excellent ideas how to manage working from home and stay well. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you can, set up a dedicated workspace in your flat, it will help to differentiate between 'research' and 'off' time and create a boundary between relaxed, social space and workspace. There is some useful <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-sit-correctly/">guidance from NHS England</a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-sit-correctly/"> </a>about how to sit at your desk correctly - try adapting this to your at-home set up. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Maintain a routine, this will look different depending on your circumstances, but can include things like getting up and ready as you usually would, taking a morning and afternoon walk, and taking regular breaks away from your workspace and screen. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you have caring responsibilities, speak to your supervisor about how to manage your research work around these. It is likely that this will be a changing situation and will require ongoing discussion. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Try to define the hours you will be working on your research and resist the temptation to check-in outside of these hours. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Even if you are isolating with symptoms, light exercise is recommended. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development"> IAD (Institute for Academic Development)</a> at the University has begun offering <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/iad4researchers/category/pop-up-training/">advice for researchers</a> which may be helpful to you.</span></span></span></span> <span><span><span><span>They will also send out IAD newsletters w/c 30 March 2020 for PGRs and research staff, and are starting PGR virtual coffee breaks on 1 April.</span></span></span></span> </span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>The University of Edinburgh is now formally advising all students currently on study/work placements abroad to return to their permanent residence if they are able to do so, and if they have a safe place to return to. </span></strong><span> This is based on the exceptional travel advisory notices issued by </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus"><span>the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO</span></a><span>) on 23 March 2020, urging all British citizens currently abroad to return to the UK now, if commercial flights are still available. We are aware that similar guidance has been issued to citizens of other countries.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>However, we understand that not all students are in a situation where it would be safe to travel, due to restrictions, concerns about exposing themselves to risks by travelling through busy airports, family circumstances etc. <strong>For those who feel that it is safer to remain in your host country, we will continue to support you as best we can in-country for the duration of your period abroad</strong>. You will need to make sure that you have a safe and comfortable place to stay and be mindful that you may need to stay longer than initially planned, if travel restrictions or lack of travel options prevent you from returning home at the end of your exchange. Please also make sure you keep monitoring the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sudan"><span>FCO travel advice</span></a><span> for your host country, and continue to follow the relevant health and safety advice.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Keep connected.</strong> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Be mindful of assumptions about others</strong>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Stay healthy.</strong> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
