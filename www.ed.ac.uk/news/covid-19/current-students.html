<p>The University is pleased to announce financial support for students who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of <a href="../covid-19.html">Covid-19</a>. This represents hardship funding we receive from the government and University funds. The funds can be used to cover any exceptional costs you may have incurred in relation to accommodation, subsistence, and travel. The financial support is available to matriculated UG, PGT, PGR students across fee statuses. Exceptionally, we will also make these funds available to those who graduate this summer and so you may apply at any time between now and 31 July 2020. </p>

<p>Visit the <a class="uoe-published uoe-node-link" data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-funding/financial-support/additional-financial-assistance/covid-19" title="Financial Support - Coronavirus (Covid-19)">student funding pages</a> to download the form and for further details. All forms and inquiries should be submitted to <a href="mailto:studentfunding@ed.ac.uk">studentfunding@ed.ac.uk</a>. The Scholarship and Student Funding team supported by other colleagues aim to process applications within 10 working days and will keep the webpages updated if the processing time extends. </p>

<p>The University will however not be offering compensation for tuition fees due to the outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19) as teaching for all taught students – undergraduate and postgraduate – is continuing, from 23 March 2020. It is, however, being delivered remotely from 23 March, with alternative assessments and online exams being introduced. </p>

<p>If you are unhappy, you can of course make a complaint at any time under the University’s Complaint Handling Procedure (CHP) – <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/university-secretary-group/complaint-handling-procedure/procedure">you can find more details about this online</a>. The CHP does not cover complaints which are requests for compensation only. </p>

<p><span><span><span>We feel very strongly that it is essential that assessment should continue, albeit some of it in an adapted form. This will not ignore the extraordinary circumstances we are in. The University’s approach to any major disruption to its operations is to minimise the impact on students while maintaining academic standards. It is important that you – and others, such as employers - can have confidence in your qualification; we do not think it would be helpful for the class of 2020 to be known as the class that graduated without doing their final exams. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Also, many students were relying on their final exams to improve their course marks, or overall average, and we feel it would be unfair to deny you this opportunity altogether. We will, however, be replacing traditional exams with “open book” exams or alternative assessments, as described above. Boards of Examiners will be provided will information about the nature of the disruption that taken place during the past academic year and will be provided with guidance on how to reflect this disruption when they are considering course and programme results.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For the small number of (primarily quantitative) exams offered on a shorter basis (normally 2-3 hours), with the addition of one hour for students to submit their work, students who are offered extended time as a reasonable adjustment will receive an additional one hour. This means that, where the exam is being offered as a two-hour exam, with an additional hour for submitting your work, you will receive three hours to complete the exam, and an additional hour to submit your work (i.e. a total of 4 hours instead of 3).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where final exams have been replaced with coursework assignments, students who are able to request extensions to deadlines as a reasonable adjustment will be able to do so for these assessments in the usual way.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Students who normally receive an adjustment preventing them from being penalised in relation to spelling or grammar in their work will have this applied in the normal way.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A very small number of students usually receive the assistance of a scribe when they undertake written exams; where Schools are offering an alternative form of assessment to a student who would usually have the assistance of a scribe, they should contact the Student Disability Service for advice, </span><a href="mailto:disability.service@ed.ac.uk"><span>disability.service@ed.ac.uk</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you are at all uncertain about what adjustments you will be offered for your remaining assessments, please contact your School.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We recognise that during this uncertain time remote working is not easy. It is important to keep in regular contact with your supervisor or supervisory team. In addition, many Schools or research groups have set up social networks to help with keeping in touch. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Here are some excellent ideas how to manage working from home and stay well. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you can, set up a dedicated workspace in your flat, it will help to differentiate between 'research' and 'off' time and create a boundary between relaxed, social space and workspace. There is some useful <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-body/how-to-sit-correctly/">guidance from NHS England</a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>about how to sit at your desk correctly - try adapting this to your at-home set up. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Maintain a routine, this will look different depending on your circumstances, but can include things like getting up and ready as you usually would, taking a morning and afternoon walk, and taking regular breaks away from your workspace and screen. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you have caring responsibilities, speak to your supervisor about how to manage your research work around these. It is likely that this will be a changing situation and will require ongoing discussion. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Try to define the hours you will be working on your research and resist the temptation to check-in outside of these hours. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Even if you are isolating with symptoms, light exercise is recommended. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development"> IAD (Institute for Academic Development)</a> at the University has begun offering <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/iad4researchers/category/pop-up-training/">advice for researchers</a> which may be helpful to you.</span></span></span></span> <span><span><span><span>They will also send out IAD newsletters w/c 30 March 2020 for PGRs and research staff, and are starting PGR virtual coffee breaks on 1 April.</span></span></span></span> </span></span></li>

<p>The Main Library in George Square is currently closed. <span><span>We are extending loan periods during the closure and no fines will be accrued during this time. All loans – including standard loans, short loans and reserve – are renewed until 22nd June, after which we will review the situation.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Feeling overwhelmed or anxious by the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak is understandable. We appreciate that you may have concerns about how this will impact you or your family and friends. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Ways to Manage Fears &amp; Anxieties:</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Keep connected.</strong> Maintaining social networks, even online, can help maintain a sense of normality, and provide valuable outlets for sharing feelings and relieving stress.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Be mindful of assumptions about others</strong>. Someone who has a cough or a fever does not necessarily have coronavirus.  Self-awareness is important in not stigmatizing others in our community.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong>Stay healthy.</strong> Continue to practise good hygiene measures:</span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span>Avoid direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol hand sanitiser, after coughing or sneezing, after going to the toilet, and prior to eating and drinking.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissues and disposing of them in nearest waste bin after use.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Avoid contact with others who are sick and stay home while sick.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
