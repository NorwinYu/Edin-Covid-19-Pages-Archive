	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In most cases, take-home, open-book exams will be made available for you to complete within a 48-hour period. You do not need to spend 48 hours working on your answer! An open-book exam paper will typically take approximately the same length of time as the original to complete; the extra time allows all students to complete comfortably, including where they normally receive additional time to complete an exam as a reasonable adjustment. The 48-hour period applies no matter your personal circumstances or which time zone you are in.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A small number of take-home exams (primarily in quantitative subjects such as Mathematics, Informatics, Physics and Astronomy, and Economics), plus some with strict professional body requirements, will be offered with a shorter time allocation, which will be the time scheduled for the original, in-person exam (usually 2-3 hours), plus one hour to submit your finished work. Your School will advise you of the details where this applies to you.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Your open book exam answers will be checked by Turnitin software to monitor for plagiarism and collusion.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>We feel very strongly that it is essential that assessment should continue, albeit some of it in an adapted form. This will not ignore the extraordinary circumstances we are in. The University’s approach to any major disruption to its operations is to minimise the impact on students while maintaining academic standards. It is important that you – and others, such as employers - can have confidence in your qualification; we do not think it would be helpful for the class of 2020 to be known as the class that graduated without doing their final exams. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Also, many students were relying on their final exams to improve their course marks, or overall average, and we feel it would be unfair to deny you this opportunity altogether. We will, however, be replacing traditional exams with “open book” exams or alternative assessments, as described above. Boards of Examiners will be provided will information about the nature of the disruption that taken place during the past academic year and will be provided with guidance on how to reflect this disruption when they are considering course and programme results.</span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span>Undergraduate students should engage with the remote teaching provided by their School.  Results of assessments and exams will be recorded on your student record once marked.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>For the small number of (primarily quantitative) exams offered on a shorter basis (normally 2-3 hours), with the addition of one hour for students to submit their work, students who are offered extended time as a reasonable adjustment will receive an additional one hour.

<p><span><span><span><span>Where final exams have been replaced with coursework assignments, students who are able to request extensions to deadlines as a reasonable adjustment will be able to do so for these assessments in the usual way.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The University is taking steps to ensure that you are not disadvantaged in your academic performance by the impact of Covid-19. Boards of Examiners, who decide your course and programme results, will be given detailed information about the impact on each of your courses of both Covid-19 and the recent industrial action to help them to make decisions in your best interests.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Please do not submit a special circumstances request about the general impact of Covid-19 or industrial action, since Boards of Examiners will already be taking account of this. “General impact” means things like:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Increased stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Reduced contact with relatives and friends;</span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span>Cancellation of classes;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Reduced access to supervision/academic advice on your assessments.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>You should submit a special circumstances request if you have experienced a unique, significant impact due to Covid-19, or the industrial action. For example, this might be because you have:              </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Been ill with Covid-19;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Experienced the exacerbation of an existing health condition due to the pandemic situation or related to the impact of industrial action;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Experienced the death or serious illness of someone close to you; </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Taken on exceptional caring responsibilities due to Covid-19;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Been required to carry out more paid work than usual, as a “key worker” (e.g. in healthcare, retail, delivery);</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Experienced significant and prolonged problems with access to teaching and learning materials, e.g. due to connectivity, power, or equipment issues.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Providing this additional information will help your Board of Examiners to decide what action to take in your best interest.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You can also submit a special circumstances request as usual if your assessments – especially those from earlier in the Semester – have been affected by other circumstances beyond your control. Information about what would normally qualify as special circumstances is <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/assessment/special-circumstances"><span>available on our website</span></a>. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have been affected by special circumstances, you should submit information in writing. You should do this through the normal route in your School.</span></span></span></p>

For some of you it may be necessary to change topic or focus e.g. moving away from a placement or practical project to a desk-based project etc. However in some cases, we understand it may now be impractical for you to continue with your dissertation – e.g. if the facilities that you need access to (lab, collections, studios etc.) are closed because of the pandemic, and there is no viable alternative way for you to carry out your research. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Please note that if there is no viable way for you to do your project without access to a lab or other facility then you will need to interrupt your studies for a period until you can complete your dissertation. Your School will take this decision locally as they will know best what is possible / not possible for your programme.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you are concerned that it is no longer feasible to continue with your dissertation at this time, please discuss this with your School at the earliest opportunity. If both you and your School agree that it is not feasible for you to continue with your dissertation in any form at this time because of reasons <strong>directly related to the pandemic</strong>, you will be given an Authorised Interruption of Studies for up to 12 months; any unused fees for the current year will be refunded to you and at the point that you return to the University, you will be charged those fees (at 2019/20 fee rates). [</span>We can confirm that the University Executive has approved a single year amendment to the Fee Policy for final year postgraduate (taught and research) students removing any inflation uplift on tuition fees due in 2020/21 following an Authorised Interruption of Studies which was required as a direct result of Covid-19.]</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You can also still apply to your School/Deanery for an Authorised Interruption of Studies for reasons other than those directly related to the pandemic.
