<p><span><span><span><strong><span>The University of Edinburgh is now formally advising all students currently on study/work placements abroad to return to their permanent residence if they are able to do so, and if they have a safe place to return to. </span></strong><span> This is based on the exceptional travel advisory notices issued by </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus"><span>the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO</span></a><span>) on 23 March 2020, urging all British citizens currently abroad to return to the UK now, if commercial flights are still available. We are aware that similar guidance has been issued to citizens of other countries.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>However, we understand that not all students are in a situation where it would be safe to travel, due to restrictions, concerns about exposing themselves to risks by travelling through busy airports, family circumstances etc. <strong>For those who feel that it is safer to remain in your host country, we will continue to support you as best we can in-country for the duration of your period abroad</strong>. You will need to make sure that you have a safe and comfortable place to stay and be mindful that you may need to stay longer than initially planned, if travel restrictions or lack of travel options prevent you from returning home at the end of your exchange. Please also make sure you keep monitoring the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sudan"><span>FCO travel advice</span></a><span> for your host country, and continue to follow the relevant health and safety advice.</span></span></span></span></p>
