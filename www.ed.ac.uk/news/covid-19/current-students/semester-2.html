<p><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching restarted on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Following further Scottish Government guidance - we have made the difficult decision that<strong> teaching and assessment for Undergraduate students will remain digital for the rest of the Semester</strong>, with a small number of exceptions.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The small number of exceptions include students who have already resumed hybrid education with on-campus elements this semester; and a very small number of programmes where Schools will be in contact with students on these programmes soon.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Schools are working to ensure that their current plans are adjusted to reflect the change in Scottish Government guidance and, in particular, this decision. Please stay in close contact with your School/ Deanery and key contacts such as your tutor or student support team.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>From 17th May 2021 we will seek to resume some aspects of teaching and assessment for our postgraduate taught students.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This is likely to be limited to the following activities:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Resuming some in-person teaching elements, such as dissertation/project supervision</li>
	<li>Enabling some greater access to lab and specialist spaces to support this activity, in line with existing health and safety controls</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you are not currently based in Edinburgh, there is no need for you to travel back to the city – and we would advise against this in any case due to the current travel restrictions and to limit the number of students on campus. We will continue to support your studies digitally and ensure that any students studying remotely will be not be academically disadvantaged by these changes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Your School will be in touch with you soon if there are implications for your specific programme.</p>

<p><span><span>If you have current research activities to undertake which require you to be physically present in Edinburgh, (for example, you need access to labs in order to progress with your research) then you are allowed to return to Edinburgh and be on-campus as needed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Before doing so, please check with your School/Deanery if the particular research space is currently accessible, as some facilities are not open or available to students during the lockdown.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are currently in the taught stage of your programme, or you do not need to/ cannot access on campus facilities at this stage, then you should not return to campus until the current stay at home restrictions are lifted.</span></span></p>

Only once you have received approval from your School will you be able to carry out your placement. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If, following the risk assessment, you are unable to carry out your placement, you will be able to ‘opt out’ of the mandatory placement and will be offered alternative learning from your School.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The University of Edinburgh must comply with Scottish Government regulations. Any easing of Covid-19 restrictions will be gradual, and our position therefore remains that <strong>summer graduations must remain cancelled</strong>, due to the likelihood that a number of restrictions will continue to significantly impact our delivery of in-person ceremonies.</p>

<p>Students due to graduate in our summer graduations will instead be invited to an online celebration, but please be assured that <strong>you will be invited back to attend a future on-campus event in the future</strong>. We truly regret the disappointment caused by postponing these ceremonies.</p>

<p><strong>We are keeping open the opportunity to hold on-campus ceremonies for the November graduations</strong>​​​​​​ and will continue to review this position as restrictions across Scotland ease.</p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>We strongly recommend that students take a lease break if you have no more on-campus activities this semester.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>A lease break will allow you to permanently end your accommodation contract with the University. You can currently request a break in your lease without needing to give a 28-day notice period.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you apply for a lease break before the 28<sup>th</sup> February, once your lease is broken, you will not pay rent for the rest of your contracted period in University accommodation and this will be backdated <strong>from 11 January 2021 </strong>(if you did not return to campus after the winter break).  After this date, lease breaks will be taken from the day that you contact us to advise that you would like to break your lease. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have previously applied for a rent pause, but will now need to break your lease instead, please follow the instructions above <strong>by 28th February</strong> and we will ensure your lease break is backdated to 11 January 2021.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><strong><span>Maintenance Loans</span></strong></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>It’s important that you update your student loans account with where you’ll be living each term. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where you live can also change the amount of Maintenance Loan you get paid. Students currently living in England will need to contact the Student Loans Company if you are applying for a lease break as your location can impact the amount of maintenance loan you are paid:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups is available on the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform webpages</a>.</p>
