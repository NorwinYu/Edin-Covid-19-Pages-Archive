<p><span><span><span>If, for essential purposes, you must return to campus, please follow Scottish travel guidance as well as travel guidance for other areas of the UK or any country you will be travelling from.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching restarted on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Following further Scottish Government guidance - we have made the difficult decision that<strong> teaching and assessment for Undergraduate students will remain digital for the rest of the Semester</strong>, with a small number of exceptions.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The small number of exceptions include students who have already resumed hybrid education with on-campus elements this semester; and a very small number of programmes where Schools will be in contact with students on these programmes soon.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Schools are working to ensure that their current plans are adjusted to reflect the change in Scottish Government guidance and, in particular, this decision. Please stay in close contact with your School/ Deanery and key contacts such as your tutor or student support team.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Our intention remains to resume campus-based aspects of the hybrid teaching model for Postgraduate Taught students as soon as we can do so.  We cannot yet give a date for this. – so in the meantime, <strong>for the vast majority of our postgraduate taught students all learning and teaching for Postgraduate Taught programmes will remain online until at least the end of February</strong>.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In line with the Scottish Government guidance, we will review the position again at the start of February and will be in contact with you at that point.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you’re unable to join us in person once hybrid teaching resumes, you will still be able to complete your work digitally and engage with your fellow students and our teaching staff online.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Mandatory placements</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Placements should be carried out remotely wherever possible.

<p><span><span><span><span>Mandatory placements which require in-person attendance will need to go through our risk assessment and approvals process – this includes reviewing the Covid-19 control measures the ‘host’ employer have in place. <span>Students will need to complete their School’s risk assessment alongside a staff member at your ‘host’ employer.</span> Once complete, please share this with your School for consideration. Only once you have received approval from your School will you be able to carry out your placement.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If, following the risk assessment, you are unable to carry out your placement, you will be able to ‘opt out’ of the mandatory placement and will be offered alternative learning from your School.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the continued restrictions around holding large scale events, the University has taken the difficult decision to cancel all in-person graduation ceremonies in 2021. This will impact our summer and winter graduations this year. </p>

<p>The awarding of your degree is a significant milestone and while we may not be able to celebrate in-person in 2021, you will be invited to celebrate your achievement virtually by joining one of our online celebrations. Joining our virtual ceremony enables you and your supporters to celebrate your achievement at the end of your studies. You will be invited to an in-person event when we are able to resume these in line with Scottish Government Covid-19 guidance.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We are offering students in University-managed accommodation the opportunity to break their lease or apply for a rent pause. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><strong><span>What is a lease break? </span></strong></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>A lease break allows you to permanently end your accommodation contract with the University. You can currently request a break in your lease without needing to give a 28-day notice period. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We recommend that you take a lease break if you have no more on campus teaching this semester, unless you have one of the specific special circumstances listed above.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Once your lease is broken, you will not pay rent for the rest of your contracted period in University accommodation and this will be backdated <strong>from 11 January 2021.</strong> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Once you have broken your lease, if your circumstances change or travel restrictions are eased at a later date, we will be happy to reinstate your contract if you wish to return to accommodation (either to your original room or a room of a similar standard and price).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Find out how to apply for a lease break in our ‘Breaking your lease’ FAQ.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><strong><span>What is a rent pause?</span></strong></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>We are only offering rent pauses for students who are not currently living in their University-managed student accommodation but may <strong>return to Edinburgh at a later date </strong></span></span></span></span><strong>for scheduled in-person activities</strong> or because of <span><span><span><span>one of the extenuating circumstances listed in our FAQ above. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The deadline for rent pause applications is 15 February. Please read our ‘Applying for a rent pause’ FAQ to find out how to apply.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span><span>Removing your possessions</span></span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span><span>If you have not yet removed your possessions, please be aware that you must not return to University accommodation to collect your belongings, since this is deemed to be “non-essential” travel. Once travel restrictions are relaxed, we will contact you to provide suitable arrangements for you to collect your belongings.</span></span></span></p>

<p>However, if it is essential that you must return to collect your belongings before restrictions are lifted, please follow government travel guidance and <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-moving-home/pages/advice-to-the-public/#propertymoves">guidance on moving home</a>. <strong>You will need to book a time-slot to arrive at your accommodation using our online booking system </strong>- this will notify us of your planned date for the collection of your belongings.</p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups is available on the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform webpages</a>.</p>
