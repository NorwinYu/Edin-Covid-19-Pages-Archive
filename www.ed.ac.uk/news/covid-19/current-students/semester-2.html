<p><span><span><span>Travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK is not legal other than for specific exempt purposes (such as for education that cannot be conducted remotely).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>In line with Scottish Government guidance, students should not return to their term-time accommodation until such time as on-campus teaching resumes, other than in specific special circumstances, </strong>for example: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Your in-person teaching has commenced</span></span></span></li>
	<li>
	<p>To participate in an in-person mandatory work placement as part of your course of study</p>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span>You are currently in temporary accommodation which you need to vacate</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>For employment purposes (for work that cannot be undertaken from home)</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Your home location is unsuitable for study</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>You need to access health &amp; wellbeing support which can only be provided in Edinburgh</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>You are a PHD student and you are required to be in Edinburgh to conduct your research</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>You are an international student and you have already purchased and cannot change travel tickets</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>We will continue to support those students who are currently staying in our University accommodation.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If, for essential purposes, you must return to campus, please follow Scottish travel guidance as well as travel guidance for other areas of the UK or any country you will be travelling from.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are planning to return to campus, you must now notify us before you travel and to let us know why you need to return under the current restrictions. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/covid-19/current-students/intention-to-travel">Notify us if you are travelling back to Edinburgh</a></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching restarted on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Following further Scottish Government guidance - we have made the difficult decision that<strong> teaching and assessment for Undergraduate students will remain digital for the rest of the Semester</strong>, with a small number of exceptions.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The small number of exceptions include students who have already resumed hybrid education with on-campus elements this semester; and a very small number of programmes where Schools will be in contact with students on these programmes soon.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Schools are working to ensure that their current plans are adjusted to reflect the change in Scottish Government guidance and, in particular, this decision. Please stay in close contact with your School/ Deanery and key contacts such as your tutor or student support team.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Our intention remains to resume campus-based aspects of the hybrid teaching model for Postgraduate Taught students as soon as we can do so.  We cannot yet give a date for this. – so in the meantime, <strong>for the vast majority of our postgraduate taught students all learning and teaching for Postgraduate Taught programmes will remain online until at least the end of February</strong>.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In line with the Scottish Government guidance, we will review the position again at the start of February and will be in contact with you at that point.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Mandatory placements</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Placements should be carried out remotely wherever possible.

<p><span><span><span><span>Mandatory placements which require in-person attendance will need to go through our risk assessment and approvals process – this includes reviewing the Covid-19 control measures the ‘host’ employer have in place. <span>Students will need to complete their School’s risk assessment alongside a staff member at your ‘host’ employer.</span> Once complete, please share this with your School for consideration. Only once you have received approval from your School will you be able to carry out your placement.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If, following the risk assessment, you are unable to carry out your placement, you will be able to ‘opt out’ of the mandatory placement and will be offered alternative learning from your School.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the continued restrictions around holding large scale events, the University has taken the difficult decision to cancel all in-person graduation ceremonies in 2021. This will impact our summer and winter graduations this year. </p>

<p>The awarding of your degree is a significant milestone and while we may not be able to celebrate in-person in 2021, you will be invited to celebrate your achievement virtually by joining one of our online celebrations. Joining our virtual ceremony enables you and your supporters to celebrate your achievement at the end of your studies. You will be invited to an in-person event when we are able to resume these in line with Scottish Government Covid-19 guidance.</p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>In line with Scottish Government guidance, international students should not return to their term-time accommodation until such time as on-campus teaching resumes</strong><strong>, other than in specific special circumstances</strong>. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You should check with your School in advance to confirm when your course will start and when you should arrive on campus.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Students who are currently overseas should not travel to Scotland until face-to-face teaching begins for them. International students who have already arranged travel should speak to our Student Immigration Service in the first instance to discuss their circumstances. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you are planning to travel to campus, you must now <strong>notify us before you travel</strong> and to let us know why you need to return under the current restrictions. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>We strongly recommend that students take a lease break if you have no more on-campus activities this semester.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>A lease break will allow you to permanently end your accommodation contract with the University. You can currently request a break in your lease without needing to give a 28-day notice period.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you apply for a lease break before the 28<sup>th</sup> February, once your lease is broken, you will not pay rent for the rest of your contracted period in University accommodation and this will be backdated <strong>from 11 January 2021 </strong>(if you did not return to campus after the winter break).  After this date, lease breaks will be taken from the day that you contact us to advise that you would like to break your lease. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have previously applied for a rent pause, but will now need to break your lease instead, please follow the instructions above <strong>by 28th February</strong> and we will ensure your lease break is backdated to 11 January 2021.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><strong><span>Maintenance Loans</span></strong></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>It’s important that you update your student loans account with where you’ll be living each term. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where you live can also change the amount of Maintenance Loan you get paid. Students currently living in England will need to contact the Student Loans Company if you are applying for a lease break as your location can impact the amount of maintenance loan you are paid:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups is available on the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform webpages</a>.</p>
