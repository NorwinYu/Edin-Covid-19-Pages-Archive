<p><span><span><span><strong>We are reviewing the implications of the recent Government announcements for Semester 2 return. The information below is subject to review.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In December, we announced plans to welcome undergraduate students back to campus for Semester 2 in a series of phases. Your School will have been in touch with you at the time with full details. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Below we have outlined some key points about what the new restrictions will mean for you and your return to campus: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Undergraduates</strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All learning and teaching will restart on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 digitally.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who were due to resume in-person, on-campus elements in the week commencing 4th and 11th January and had been contacted by their Schools can do so.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is a delay to all those who were due to start the in-person, on-campus elements from 25th January. We do not know how long that delay will be but we are working with the Scottish Government to confirm details as soon as possible, as we realise how important this is for your planning.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Library and study facilities will remain open with existing health and safety measures in place.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Postgraduate taught programmes</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Postgraduate research</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The new restrictions do not alter the information we are providing to <strong>postgraduate research students</strong> and essential research work may continue in our laboratories and other research facilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please speak with your supervisor for further information on how these new restrictions may impact your work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You can return to University by private, family vehicle if you would prefer to avoid public transport.

<p><span><span><span>If you choose to return using public transport, you should follow our guidance on how to travel safely.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you are travelling to Edinburgh from elsewhere in the UK, we strongly advise you to book an asymptomatic Covid-19 test as close to your return date as possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>To support the safe return of our students to our campuses after the winter break, we will be offering asymptomatic Covid-19 testing from <strong>Thursday 7 January – Friday 12 February 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The tests are voluntary and you do <strong>not </strong>need to have been tested in order to attend in-person teaching. But we strongly encourage you to book a test if you are returning to Edinburgh from another part of the UK. This will reduce the risk of you passing Covid-19 onto others when you and/or your housemates return to Edinburgh. </p>

<p><a  class="btn btn-lg btn-uoe"  href="travelling-home-testing.html"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check" aria-hidden="true"></span>Book a test</a></p>

<p>You should book a test as close to your return as possible - please remember that you must make two separate bookings using this form. If you are an undergraduate student, you should book your tests to coincide with the date you return to your term time accommodation. Your school should have been in contact with you regarding this.</p>
