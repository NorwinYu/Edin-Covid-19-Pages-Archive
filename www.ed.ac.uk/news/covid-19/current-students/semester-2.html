<p><span><span><span>Travel between Scotland and the rest of the UK is not legal other than for specific exempt purposes (such as education). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>In line with Scottish Government guidance, UG and PGT students should not return to their term-time accommodation until such time as on-campus teaching resumes, other than in specific special circumstances. </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>We will continue to support those students who are currently staying in our University accommodation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If, for essential purposes, you must return to campus, please follow Scottish travel guidance as well as travel guidance for other areas of the UK or any country you will be travelling from.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Travel for non-essential reasons</h3>

<p>Despite clear instruction from the Scottish Government, we are aware that some students are still planning to come back to Edinburgh even though their on-campus teaching elements won’t be happening for some time. <strong>Please help us to keep everyone safe and help stop the spread of the virus by not returning until you’ve been given a date by your School which confirms when they are planning to resume campus teaching.</strong></p>

<p>We will shortly be asking students to <strong>notify us before you travel</strong> and to let us know why you think you should be able to travel back to Edinburgh under the current restrictions. If you do return to campus and if you have no scheduled teaching or no other extenuating circumstances, then you will potentially be in breach of the law. Details of this process will be circulated shortly and I really appeal to you all to work with us on this. If you think you must travel in the next few days, please seek advice for now from the <a href="../contact-details.html">Covid Contact Centre</a> or call our Hotline on +44 (0)131 370 0494.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Below we have outlined some key points about what the new Scottish Government restrictions will mean for you: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught student</strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching will restart on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally</strong>; </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Undergraduate and postgraduate students who were due to resume in-person, on-campus elements in the week commencing 4th and 11th January and had been contacted by their Schools can do so;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong>However, there is now a delay for all other undergraduate and postgraduate taught students who were due to resume the in-person, on-campus elements of their programme on or after 25th January 2021. Learning and teaching for this group of students will remain digital until further notice </strong>and in the vast majority of cases we expect that to be throughout January and February at least.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong>In line with Scottish Government guidance, UG and PGT students should not return to their term-time accommodation until such time as on-campus teaching resumes, other than in specific special circumstances.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Please be assured that you will continue to receive an excellent standard of digital education throughout this period. Your mental health and wellbeing is an absolute priority, so we will continue to support you as much as possible, no matter where you are currently living.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Postgraduate research</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The new restrictions do not alter the information we are providing to <strong>postgraduate research students</strong> and essential research work may continue in our laboratories and other research facilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please speak with your supervisor for further information on how these new restrictions may impact your work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>
