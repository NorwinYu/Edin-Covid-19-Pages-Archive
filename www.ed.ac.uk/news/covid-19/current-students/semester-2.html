<p><span><span><span>Below we have outlined some key points about what the new Scottish Government restrictions will mean for you: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Undergraduate and Postgraduate Taught student</strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching will restart on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally</strong>; </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Undergraduate and postgraduate students who were due to resume in-person, on-campus elements in the week commencing 4th and 11th January and had been contacted by their Schools can do so;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong>However, there is now a delay for all other undergraduate and postgraduate taught students who were due to resume the in-person, on-campus elements of their programme on or after 25th January 2021. Learning and teaching for this group of students will remain digital until further notice </strong>and in the vast majority of cases we expect that to be throughout January and February at least.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><strong>In line with Scottish Government guidance, UG and PGT students should not return to their term-time accommodation until such time as on-campus teaching resumes, other than in specific special circumstances.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Please be assured that you will continue to receive an excellent standard of digital education throughout this period. Your mental health and wellbeing is an absolute priority, so we will continue to support you as much as possible, no matter where you are currently living.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Postgraduate research</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The new restrictions do not alter the information we are providing to <strong>postgraduate research students</strong> and essential research work may continue in our laboratories and other research facilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please speak with your supervisor for further information on how these new restrictions may impact your work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You can return to University by private, family vehicle if you would prefer to avoid public transport.

<p>To support the safe return of our students to our campuses after the winter break, we will be offering asymptomatic Covid-19 testing from <strong>Thursday 7 January – Friday 12 February 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>The tests are voluntary and you do <strong>not </strong>need to have been tested in order to attend in-person teaching. But we strongly encourage you to book a test if you are returning to Edinburgh from another part of the UK. This will reduce the risk of you passing Covid-19 onto others when you and/or your housemates return to Edinburgh. </p>

<p><a  class="btn btn-lg btn-uoe"  href="travelling-home-testing.html"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check" aria-hidden="true"></span>Book a test</a></p>

<p>You should book a test as close to your return as possible - please remember that you must make two separate bookings using this form. If you are an undergraduate student, you should book your tests to coincide with the date you return to your term time accommodation. Your school should have been in contact with you regarding this.</p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>
