<p><span><span><span>If, for essential purposes, you must return to campus, please follow Scottish travel guidance as well as travel guidance for other areas of the UK or any country you will be travelling from.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span>As planned, all learning and teaching restarted on programmes of study during the week beginning 11th January 2021 <strong>digitally.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Following further Scottish Government guidance - we have made the difficult decision that<strong> teaching and assessment for Undergraduate students will remain digital for the rest of the Semester</strong>, with a small number of exceptions.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The small number of exceptions include students who have already resumed hybrid education with on-campus elements this semester; and a very small number of programmes where Schools will be in contact with students on these programmes soon.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Schools are working to ensure that their current plans are adjusted to reflect the change in Scottish Government guidance and, in particular, this decision. Please stay in close contact with your School/ Deanery and key contacts such as your tutor or student support team.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Our intention remains to resume campus-based aspects of the hybrid teaching model for Postgraduate Taught students as soon as we can do so.  We cannot yet give a date for this. – so in the meantime, <strong>for the vast majority of our postgraduate taught students all learning and teaching for Postgraduate Taught programmes will remain online until at least the end of February</strong>.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In line with the Scottish Government guidance, we will review the position again at the start of February and will be in contact with you at that point.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you’re unable to join us in person once hybrid teaching resumes, you will still be able to complete your work digitally and engage with your fellow students and our teaching staff online.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you wish to permanently leave University accommodation, we will be flexible and will not hold you to the 28-day notice period. </span></span></span></p>

<p>If you would like to give notice and leave your accommodation, please let us know by <strong>Monday 15 February, 2021,</strong> by following the steps below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access your MyEd student portal via <a href="https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/" title="https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/">https://wwwmyed.ed.ac.uk</a></li>
	<li>Enter your username and password to login</li>
	<li>Click on the 'Student Life' tab and select 'Accommodation'</li>
	<li>Click 'Launch Services'</li>
	<li>Expand 'Term Time 2020 - 21'</li>
	<li>Click the “Lease Termination” button under the 'While You're Here' column</li>
</ul>

<p>If wish to break your lease but have already applied for a rent pause, please follow the instructions above and we will ensure your lease is broken from 11 January.</p>

<h4>Removing your possessions</h4>

<p><span><span><span>If you have not yet removed your possessions, please be aware students <strong>should not</strong> return to accommodation on a temporary basis to collect belongings, since this is deemed to be “non-essential” travel. Once travel restrictions are relaxed, we will contact you to provide suitable arrangements for you to collect your belongings.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you choose to appoint a courier to remove your belongings, we will assist with providing access to your room.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</p>

<p>If you believe you are at  high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 but do not have a shielding letter, see below, you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or your School (students) in the first instance to consider adjustments to allow you to work from home in the first instance or that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations.</p>

<p><strong>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</strong></p>

<p>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this.</p>

<p>The Chief Medical Officer wrote to everyone on the shielding list in the week beginning 4 January to set out advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home-guidance/">stay at home regulations</a> which came into effect on 5<sup>th</sup> January 2021.</p>

<p><span>Any students who are shielding should continue to study from home and not attend classes or placements in person. More information for students with shielded status can be found </span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here.</a></p>

<p>Further advice can be found on the Scottish Government website:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/covid-shielding/pages/changes-to-shielding-advice/">Changes to shielding advice</a></p>

<p>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </p>

<p>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups is available on the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform webpages</a>.</p>
