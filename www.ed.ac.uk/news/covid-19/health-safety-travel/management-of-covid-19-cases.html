<p><span><span>Close contacts of a person who has tested positive, will need to self-isolate for a full 10 days from the date they last came into contact with the positive case, if the contact was during their potentially infectious period. The potentially infectious period starts 48 hours prior to the onset of symptoms, or for those without symptoms, 48 hours prior to their positive test result.<span> Further information on contact tracing is available on<a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-contact-tracing"> NHS Inform</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>University process</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>NHS Health Protection team will work closely with the Health and Safety Department if any students or staff test positive. We will assist with identifying close contacts and arrange for them to self-isolate. This may involve assistance from the Schools/Departments, Timetabling Unit and/or Accommodation, Catering and Events. The Health and Safety Department will oversee this process and contact all concerned.</span></span></span></p>

<p>You will need to self-isolate if:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You have symptoms of Covid-19 or have received a positive LFT test and are waiting for a positive PCR confirmatory test result.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You have been contacted by the NHS Test and Protect team and identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 symptoms.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A member of your household has tested positive for Covid-19 or is displaying symptoms.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You have travelled to Scotland from a country which is not exempt from quarantine requirements (<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-international-travel-quarantine/">Scottish Government guidance on travel quarantine and self-isolation</a>). </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>From Monday 9th August, you can end your self-isolation period as soon as you receive a negative NHS PCR test, as long as you are post 14 days of your second vaccination. This means you will likely only need to self-isolate for a few days until the PCR result comes through. If you are medically unable to be vaccinated, you should get a PCR test as soon as possible. Provided you return a negative PCR test result and remain asymptomatic, you may end self-isolation as a close contact.</strong>​​​​​</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Information on self-isolation can be found on the Scottish Government website:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you are travelling from another country, it is likely you will need to either enter managed isolation (quarantine in a hotel) or self-isolate at home (or wherever you are planning to stay) for at least 10 days after you arrive. Further information can be found on the Scottish Government website:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>If you have taken a PCR test</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>Contact tracing will take place if a staff member has taken a PCR test because they have symptoms of Covid-19 and has subsequently received a positive result. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Contact tracing is the process for identifying people who are at risk of Coronavirus infection because they‘ve had enough contact with a person who has tested positive. These people will be given advice to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>If you have taken a lateral flow test</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>If a staff member receives a positive result from either a LFT or TestEd, they must self-isolate immediately <strong>and</strong> organise an NHS PCR test for confirmation. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The positive result of a lateral flow test will also be used to initiate contact tracing. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If the subsequent PCR test result comes back negative, this confirms that the lateral flow test was a false positive. Contact tracing will stop, the relevant traced contacts will be notified, and the staff member can stop isolation and resume their usual duties.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This guidance is based on the <a href="https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2973/documents/1_covid-19-guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings.pdf">Public Health Scotland</a> guidance as well as discussions with NHS Lothian Health Protection Team (HPT), and will be updated as required. This guidance is aimed at Schools and Departments. Accommodation, Catering and Events (ACE) have their own process to follow appropriate to their own environment. Flow charts have also been published on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/Covid19/SitePages/Covid19-Reporting-and-Recording.aspx">Covid-19 SharePoint</a> site (staff access only).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As a reminder, if you have any symptoms, you <strong>must not</strong> attend work and should contact NHS Inform to arrange a test.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Anyone who starts to feel unwell with Covid-19 symptoms whilst at work should inform a member of staff or responsible person immediately. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Mild symptoms</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Anyone with mild symptoms and do not require hospital treatment should go home as soon as you notice symptoms and self-isolate. Where possible you should minimise contact with others, e.g. use a private vehicle to go home, or walk home. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In partnership with NHS Lothian, Central Taxis are now operating a designated fleet of vehicles for the transport of those requiring a Covid-19 test, or those who begin showing symptoms in the workplace. The vehicles are ring fenced for these journeys only and are given a full chemical deep clean after each shift, all touchpoints are wiped down ongoing and drivers carried out his duty in full medical PPE. The passenger will also be asked to wear a mask and one can be supplied by the driver if required. If you need to book one of these vehicles please call 0131 229 2468 and ensure you advise the telephonist that a COVID vehicle is required.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are waiting for someone to pick you up, you should wait in an unoccupied room/area during this time and ensure other staff or students are aware not to access that area, see below for more guidance on waiting areas.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Acute symptoms</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If a staff or student is unwell with Covid-19 and they require an ambulance, call the emergency services on (9)999 and let the call handler know you are concerned about Covid-19. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>While you wait for advice or an ambulance to arrive, try to find somewhere safe for the unwell person to sit which is at least 2 metres away from other people. If possible and it is safe to do so, they should wait in an unoccupied room/ area during this time. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>It is a good idea to identify suitable areas in your buildings where staff or students could be taken if required in advance.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Personal health and safety</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Although it is natural to try and assist someone who is ill or go closer to them, try and maintain physical distancing if you can and assist them remotely by placing items, such as tissues, on a desk - ask them to step back before you step forward to place the item and then you step back before they come forward to pick them up. The Health and Safety Department have produced short videos on what to do in a <a href="https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/training/first-aid" title="First Aid training">first aid situation</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Next steps for staff</strong></span></span></span></p>
