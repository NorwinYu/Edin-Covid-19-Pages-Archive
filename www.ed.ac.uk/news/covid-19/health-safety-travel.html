<p>We expect that further social distancing measures will be enacted by the UK Government, so the University is urgently planning to prepare for this. We will be making the transition so that only “essential-services” will operate on campus from Tuesday 24th March.</p>

<p>Essential services include campus-based research related to Covid-19 as well as services which support NHS clinical activities, our student accommodation, data centres and animal welfare. We will update you as soon as we can with information on further building closures, with clear protocols about access for essential staff. </p>

<p>The Pharmacy and the University Health Centre are essential public health services and will remain open.  </p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There <span>is the unfortunate possibility that current events might cause an increase in incidents of racial harassment, aggression or abuse which some students and staff might face either on or off campus. This is never acceptable. If you face any negative or abusive comments or behaviour from anyone, you should tell someone and seek support from your Student Support team, personal tutor or supervisor, from the Students’ Association Advice Place, or from the Human Resources team. Any conversations will be handled with due care and confidentiality, and our staff will work with you to find the appropriate means of safety and redress.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>It is possible that some criminals will use the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to carry out fraudulent activity. </p>

<p>This could take many forms, but the most likely will be the use of phishing emails. We therefore want to remind all students and staff to be particularly careful of any emails that mention the following:</p>

<ul>

<h5>Hand washing</h5>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can reduce your risk of acquiring and spreading respiratory infections by practising good hygiene:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>avoiding direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>When you arrive at work or home</li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after coughing or sneezing, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after going to the toilet, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and prior to eating and drinking</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you are unable to use soap and water, hand santiser could be used but you must ensure it is 60% alcohol to be effective and you must wash your hands as soon as you are able to. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Although you may now be working from home, please ensure you continue to frequently wash your hands, in particular, if you have been outside and before eating.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand washing posters</h5>

<p>Hand washing posters have been displayed at all sinks around the estates. If you require to, you can download and print off the poster here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/news/Handwashing_poster.pdf">Hand washing poster</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Hand sanitisers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>Hand sanitisers will not be provided to buildings and we would not expect local areas to provide these unless there is a need, for example, no hand washing facilities. If supplied, they must be at least 60% alcohol to be effective. Washing hands with soap and water is the most effective means of preventing a spread and using hand sanitisers can give a false sense of cleanliness, in particular if their use is not followed up by proper hand washing.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand driers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>We are aware of a confusion regarding hand driers and whether paper towels are 'safer' to use.  As long as hands are washed correctly, as above, then either paper towels or hand driers can be used.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The advice from Health Protection Scotland continues to be that there is no need for people to wear a face mask in the local community. To protect yourself from infection, good hand hygiene is important and avoiding large crowds if you have any concern.</span></span></span>​​​​​</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>There are a number of reasons why the wearing of masks and gloves in non-healthcare settings is not advised. These include the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mask and gloves must be changed frequently and disposed of appropriately - they will become soiled very quickly with, for example, sweat build up</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>It is known that people tend to touch their face more frequently when wearing masks as they can become uncomfortable or not be sitting correctly on the face. One of the main focus of the current situation is not to touch your face to avoid infection</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The virus may still be on gloves, same as it would be on hands, but people may wash their gloved hands less as they think they are protected. The virus does not go through skin, but in through the mouth and eyes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>Current knowledge on how Covid-19 is spread has been published by Health Protection Scotland and Public Health England in various online guidance documents which are publicity available, such as the<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/web-resources-container/covid-19-guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings/"> ‘COVID-19 - Guidance for Non-Healthcare Settings’</a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There are two routes by which it is spread; droplets via coughs and sneezes which then reach others standing within 2 meters of them and/or droplets on hard surfaces, such as tables and door handles, from, for example, the hands of someone who has coughed or sneezed and not washed their hands prior to touching this surface. This is why hand and respiratory hygiene, as well as social distancing, is vitally important for limiting the spread of covid-19.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There is currently no evidence to suggest these droplets can become aerosolised and move over long distances in the air, such as within air handling units – droplets which are sneezed or coughed out travel around 2 meters because of the force behind the sneeze or cough.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The University is in constant contact with Health Protection Scotland and we will update any guidance given based on information discussed with the local NHS Health Protection Team.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In a situation where a person has suffered illness or accident, the first aiders who arrive on scene are taught to consider not only the condition of the casualty, but also, first and foremost, to ensure their own safety. This includes any hygiene and infection risk from the casualty. First aiders are trained therefore to consider any risk from the casualty from poisons or infectious agents, and to make a decision on the basis of the evidence available at the time. The decision in these circumstances may be to administer CPR by carrying out chest compressions, but not delivering rescue breaths. There is some evidence that adequate ventilation may be achieved if the airway is kept open during such chest compressions.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have had several enquiries from University of Edinburgh trained first aiders regarding the situation during the current coronavirus outbreak. The advice is to follow the procedure outlined above, that is:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Assess the situation and check for your own safety.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Approach the casualty if safe to do so, then check the casualty for response, airway and breathing, as normal.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If the casualty is not breathing, then make a decision on whether or not you should carry out normal CPR using the 30 chest compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths cycle. If you decide it is not safe to carry out rescue breaths, then set the casualty’s head and neck as best you can to keep the airway open, and then begin chest compressions only. Keep doing this for as long as you can or until help arrives, checking occasionally that the airway is still open.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>Even for essential travel, we would encourage all areas to consider contingency arrangements should the advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and University change. The Covid-19 outbreak is a rapidly developing situation and it is difficult to predict how things may change in the UK or internationally over the coming weeks and months and it is difficult to anticipate what advice will be issued in the future, and the impact this will have on travellers.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Consideration should be given to whether the travel is essential, whether it can be accomplished in another manner (for example Skype or in a different location) or postponed till a date in the future or indefinitely. What are the arrangements should individuals not be allowed to return from an area.  This should be taken into consideration when undertaking a Business Travel Risk Assessment.</span></span></span></p>
