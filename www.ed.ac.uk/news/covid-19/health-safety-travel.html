<p><span><span><span>Test and Protect is the name of the process in Scotland to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the community, by putting into practice the 'test, trace, isolate, support' strategy.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Testing</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Anyone with symptoms of coronavirus (a new, continuous cough; fever; loss of, or change in, their sense of smell or taste) should be tested. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>See the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-testing">NHS inform</a> website for more information. </span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Arranging a Test</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>You can book an appointment at a drive-through test centre, or request a test kit to be sent to your home.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In order to access a test you need to follow an online guide which will ask you a series of questions.  </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you choose to receive a test at a drive-through centre, you will be given an appointment time on a priority basis.  A priority system for testing appointments is in place for key workers and members of their household, to support them returning to work when it is safe to do so.  You will be asked to identify whether you are a key worker (or household contact of) or not, and which priority group you associate with. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Which kind of key worker category applies to you or your household member?  This <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested/pages/who-can-be-tested/">detailed guide</a> should help.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The University has not set up a separate registration process via an employer portal for testing of key workers, and so all members of staff, their family members, and students, who wish to arrange a test should do so via the NHS link below.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/self-help-guides/self-help-guide-access-to-testing-for-coronavirus">online guide</a> to access a test is available from the NHS. If you cannot get online, call </span></span></span>0800 028 2816 for further guidance.</p>

<p>If you are not normally domiciled in Scotland, please call 0300 303 2713 (from 7am till 11pm) to arrange a home kit to be sent to your term time address.</p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Test results</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>The test will confirm if a person with symptoms has the virus. It won’t confirm whether they have been infected and recovered.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Results are sent by text to your mobile phone and should be with you within 48 hours. They are issued to whoever booked the test.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Further information on testing is available on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-testing">NHS Inform website</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Contact tracing</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Contact tracing is a process for identifying people who are at risk of Coronavirus infection because they‘ve had enough contact with a person who has tested positive. These people will be given advice to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Everyone who tests positive for Coronavirus will be put in touch with their local contact tracing team to help identify who they’ve been in close contact with.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>A close contact is defined as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>those that are living in the same household as a case</li>
	<li>face to face contact with a case for any length of time within 1 metre of a case</li>
	<li>extended close contact within 2 metres for more than 15 minutes with a case</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Close contacts will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days. In addition, and as noted above, all close contacts of people who have tested positive for coronavirus will be offered a test themselves, even if they have no symptoms. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Further information on contact tracing is available on<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/test-and-protect/coronavirus-covid-19-contact-tracing"> NHS Inform</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Protect Scotland app</h3>

<p>NHS Scotland has launched a free, mobile phone app called Protect Scotland which is to designed identify people who may be at risk from Covid because they were in close contact with someone who has the virus. <span><span><span>The app alerts users if they have been in close contact with another app user who tests positive. And if a user tests positive, it can help determine contacts that they may have otherwise missed while keeping personal information private and anonymous. </span></span></span></p>

<p>For more information on the app please visit the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.protect.scot/">Protect Scotland website</a> or download it through the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/id1526637715">App Store</a> and <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.scot.covidtracker">Google Play</a>.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>The information below is based on the current public health advice. </span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you or someone in your household has symptoms of Coronavirus (Covid-19) – i.e. a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature - you must self-isolate, i.e. stay at home, for:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>10 days</span></strong><span> from when your symptoms started <strong>if you live alone</strong>, or</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>10 days </span></strong><span>if you are the <strong>first</strong> in your household to develop symptoms, or</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>14 days if you live with others</span></strong><span> and they have symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>If you are the first in your household to develop symptoms:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you need to stay at home for 10 days from the day your symptoms start</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>everyone else in your household needs to stay at home for 14 days (from the day your symptoms start)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>if someone in your household then develops symptoms </span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>they need to self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of their symptoms. This could mean that they have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The 14 day ‘whole household’ isolation does not restart each time a member of the household develops symptoms. So you don’t need to self-isolate beyond 10 days, unless you continue to have a high temperature.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>For example: </span></strong><span>you develop symptoms (day one). You have to stay at home for 10 days. Everyone else has to stay at home for 14 days. If on day 10 someone you live with develops symptoms, they need to stay at home for 10 days – so in total they will have to self-isolate for 20 days. You don’t need to after day 10. No-one else needs to self-isolate after day 14, unless they too develop symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>If a member of your household is the first to develop symptoms:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>they need to stay at home for 10 days from the day their symptoms start</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you and everyone else in your household need to stay at home for 14 days </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>if you then develop symptoms </span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you need to self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of your symptoms. This could mean that you have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The 14 day ‘whole household’ isolation does not restart when you develop symptoms.   </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>For example: </span></strong><span>someone you live with develops symptoms (day one). They have to stay at home for 10 days. You and everyone else in your household has to stay at home for 14 days. If on day 10 you develop symptoms, you need to stay at home for 10 days – so in total you will have to self-isolate for 20 days. No-one else needs to self-isolate after day 14, unless they too develop symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>If you are arriving in the UK after Monday 8th June 2020:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>During the 14 day self-isolation period you will be unable to leave the place you are staying except under certain circumstances. Full information can be found on the </span><span><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-health-checks-at-borders/pages/self-isolation/"><span>Scottish Government website</span></a></span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You will need to let your line manager know that you have to self-isolate for 14 days. If you can work from home you should do so.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Further information on when and how to self-isolate is available on the </span><a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-households-with-possible-coronavirus-infection">NHS Scotland website</a>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The UK government has identified two distinct groups who are more vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Further information on Covid-19 and vulnerable groups, including the medical conditions and other factors within the two vulnerable groups, is available on <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-covid-19-general-advice">NHS Inform</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you are advised to discuss your concerns directly with management (staff) or <span>your School (students) </span>in the first instance to consider adjustments that may be made to support your return to work/campus, these may be part of Equality/disability considerations. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span>I have been shielding (extremely high risk)</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you are considered to be at extremely high risk of severe illness from Covid-19 you should have received a letter from NHS Scotland or your GP advising you of this. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Shielding is being paused from 1st August. This means that staff or students who received a shielding letter (valid to 31st July) will now be able to return to work / study on campus if required to do so. More information for students with shielded status can be found <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/students/welcome-back/visiting-campus/building-access-and-safety-measures">here. </a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If you have an underlying health condition or take regular prescription medicines, but you remain unsure whether you fall into one of the more vulnerable groups, you should contact your own GP practice for advice. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This guidance is based on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://hpspubsrepo.blob.core.windows.net/hps-website/nss/2973/documents/1_covid-19-guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings.pdf">Public Health Scotland</a> guidance as well as discussions with NHS Lothian Health Protection Team (HPT), and will be updated as required. This guidance is aimed at Schools and Department. Accommodation, Catering and Events (ACE) have their own process to follow appropriate to their own environment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As a reminder, if you have any symptoms, you <strong>must not</strong> attend work and should contact NHS Inform to arrange a test.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Anyone who starts to feel unwell with any of the main covid-19 symptoms whilst at work should inform a member of staff or responsible person immediately. These symptoms are:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>High temperature</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>New or continuous cough</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Loss of taste or smell</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Mild symptoms</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>If the affected person has mild symptoms they should go home as soon as they notice symptoms and self-isolate. Where possible they should minimise contact with others, e.g. use a private vehicle to go home. If they do not have their own private transport, then it may be possible to arrange a contract taxi for them (via the University contract taxi service Central Taxis), check locally in your School or Department what arrangements are in place. If they are using public transport, they should try to keep away from other people and catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue as well as wear the mandatory face covering. If they don’t have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of the elbow.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If they are waiting for someone to pick them up, place them in an unoccupied room/area during this time and ensure other staff or students are aware not to access that area, see below for more guidance on waiting areas.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Acute symptoms</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>If they are so unwell that they require an ambulance, call the emergency services on (9)999 and let the call handler know you are concerned about Covid-19. Whilst you wait for advice or an ambulance to arrive, try to find somewhere safe for the unwell person to sit which is at least 2 metres away from other people.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If possible and it is safe to do so, find a room or area where they can be isolated behind a closed door, such as a staff office or meeting room. If it is possible to open a window, do so for ventilation. The individual should avoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze, and then put the tissue in the bin. If no bin is available, put the tissue in a bag or pocket for disposing in a bin later. If you don’t have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. Where possible, a separate bathroom should be designated for the individual to use.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>It is a good idea to identify suitable areas in your buildings where staff or students could be taken if required in advance.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Personal health and safety</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Although it is natural to try and assist someone who is ill or go closer to them, try and avoid going closer than 2 metres if you can and assist them remotely by placing items, such as tissues, on a desk - ask them to step back before you step forward to place the item and then you step back before they come forward to pick them up. The Health and Safety Department have produced short videos on what to do in a <a class="uoe-published uoe-node-link" data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/training/first-aid" title="First Aid training">first aid situation</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand washing</h5>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can reduce your risk of acquiring and spreading respiratory infections by practising good hygiene:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>avoiding direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>When you arrive at work or home</li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after coughing or sneezing, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after going to the toilet, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and prior to eating and drinking</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you are unable to use soap and water, hand santiser could be used but you must ensure it is 60% alcohol to be effective and you must wash your hands as soon as you are able to. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Although you may now be working from home, please ensure you continue to frequently wash your hands, in particular, if you have been outside and before eating.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand washing posters</h5>

<p>Hand washing posters have been displayed at all sinks around the estates. If you require to, you can download and print off the poster here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/news/Handwashing_poster.pdf">Hand washing poster</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Hand sanitisers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>As our buildings reopen, hand sanitisers will be supplied in the entrance way of all open buildings. Local risk assessments will inform if more are required. However, washing hands with soap and water is still the most effective means of preventing a spread and if using hand sanitisers you should also follow this up by proper hand washing.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand driers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>We are aware of a confusion regarding hand driers and whether paper towels are 'safer' to use.  As long as hands are washed correctly, as above, then either paper towels or hand driers can be used.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>From 10 July, the Scottish Government announced that everyone in Scotland must – by law – wear a face covering in shops and on public transport. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Wearing a face covering is intended to help protect others and reduce transmission in the community, particularly where – as advised by the Scottish Government – physical distancing is more difficult<strong>.  </strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The University has implemented guidance from the Scottish Government and Health Protection Scotland to manage and reduce the risk from Covid-19. We will continue to do this, with physical distancing, good standards of hand and respiratory hygiene, and enhanced cleaning regimes being the most important and effective things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid-19. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>In line with Scottish Government guidance, it is now mandatory that face coverings are worn in all of our libraries and study spaces. If and when this guidance becomes stronger, we will adjust accordingly but we are already expecting everyone to wear face coverings in all University buildings unless individuals have good reasons for not wearing one.​​​</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>A face covering can be any covering of the mouth and nose that is made of cloth or other textiles and through which you can breathe. Religious face coverings that cover the mouth and the nose count as face coverings for these purposes.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Staff and students should be aware that there are certain conditions and hidden disabilities that may preclude persons from wearing face coverings and should ensure they understand and respect this. In line with our Dignity &amp; Respect policy, any bullying or harassment on this issue will not be tolerated. Also, staff are not required to wear a face covering if they are physically separated, by means of, for example, partition screens, from other staff or students, or if they maintain a 2 metre distance from other staff or students.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The advice from Health Protection Scotland continues to be that <strong>there is</strong> <strong>no need or requirement</strong> for people to wear a surgical or fitted face mask or gloves in the local community, including the University campus. The University is continuing to concentrate on social distancing and hand and respiratory hygiene as these are still the best way to protect yourself and others. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Please note, face coverings and face masks (both surgical or fitted) are not the same. Face coverings can be made of any soft material and simply cover the mouth and nose and are designed to protect others. Face masks are designed to afford protection to both the wearer and others. Further <a class="uoe-published uoe-node-link" data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/health-safety/guidance/ppe/rpe" title="Respiratory protective equipment">University guidance on face masks</a> has been published on the Health and Safety website.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There are particular reasons why wearing face masks and gloves in non-healthcare settings is not advised. These include the following:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Masks and gloves must be changed frequently and disposed of appropriately – they will become soiled very quickly, for example with sweat build up.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Taking off masks and gloves must be undertaken in a safe manner to avoid cross contamination.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>People tend to touch their face more frequently when wearing masks as they can become uncomfortable or not be correctly fitted – strong advice to avoid infection in the current situation is to not touch your face.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The virus may still exist on gloves, in the same way as it would on hands, and be transferred from gloves onto other hard surfaces. After wearing gloves, people may wash their hands less as they think they are protected, which increases the risk when touching their mouth or eyes.</span></span></span></li>

<p>It is possible that some criminals will use the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to carry out fraudulent activity. </p>

<p>This could take many forms, but the most likely will be the use of phishing emails. We therefore want to remind all students and staff to be particularly careful of any emails that mention the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'check remote connectivity’</li>
	<li>‘maintain remote access’</li>
	<li>‘help your organisation/the University check remote access’</li>

</ul>

<p>Whilst there might be an increase in remote working during this period, the University would not send you an email asking you to ‘click on a link to check remote connectivity’. </p>

<p>If you do receive any emails asking you to do this, please do not click on any links but follow existing reporting processes and <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/infosec/contact">report it to the IS Helpline</a>.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span><span><span>In a situation where a person has suffered illness or accident, the first aiders who arrive on scene are taught to consider not only the condition of the casualty, but also, first and foremost, to ensure their own safety. This includes any hygiene and infection risk from the casualty. First aiders are trained therefore to consider any risk from the casualty from poisons or infectious agents, and to make a decision on the basis of the evidence available at the time. The decision in these circumstances may be to administer CPR by carrying out chest compressions, but not delivering rescue breaths. There is some evidence that adequate ventilation may be achieved if the airway is kept open during such chest compressions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have had several enquiries from University of Edinburgh trained first aiders regarding the situation during the current coronavirus outbreak. The advice is to follow the procedure outlined above, that is:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Assess the situation and check for your own safety.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Approach the casualty if safe to do so, then check the casualty for response by speaking loudly and looking for signs of movement from the chest and abdomen.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Resuscitation Council UK Guidelines 2015 state “If you are untrained or unable to do rescue breaths, give chest compression-only CPR (i.e. continuous compressions at a rate of at least 100–120 min</span><span><span>-1</span></span><span>)”. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Because of the heightened awareness of the possibility that the casualty may have COVID-19, Resuscitation Council UK offers this advice:  </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Recognise cardiac arrest by looking for the absence of signs of life and the absence of normal breathing. Do not listen or feel for breathing by placing your ear and cheek close to the patient’s mouth. If you are in any doubt about confirming cardiac arrest, the default position is to start chest compressions until help arrives. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Make sure an ambulance is on its way. If COVID 19 is suspected, tell them when you call 999. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If there is a perceived risk of infection, rescuers should place a cloth/towel over the casualty’s mouth and nose and attempt compression only CPR and early defibrillation until the ambulance (or advanced care team) arrives. Put hands together in the middle of the chest and push hard and fast.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Travelling to and entering the UK on or after 8 June 2020 </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>For those arriving in the UK after Monday 8<sup>th</sup> June 2020, the UK Government has implemented a period of self-isolation which is outlined below.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Before travelling to the UK</span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you will be entering the UK (except from </span>certain exempt countries which can be found on the <a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.gov.scot/news/quarantine-rule-ends-for-travellers-arriving-from-lower-risk-countries-and-territories/">Scottish Government website</a>)​<span> on or after Monday 8<sup>th</sup> June you must complete an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/provide-journey-contact-details-before-travel-uk"><span>on-line passenger locator form</span></a></span><span>, and do so 48 hours before you arrive in the UK. You must provide details about your journey and your contact details in the UK.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You will need to show your completed form when you arrive at the UK border, either by printing a copy, or by showing it on your phone. </span></span><span>If you do not complete the form, or refuse to do so, you may be fined. If you are unable to demonstrate where you will self-isolate, you may be required to do so in accommodation arranged by the UK Government. Further information is available on the </span><span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control"><span>UK Government website</span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Arriving in the UK </span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>When you arrive at the UK border you will need to show that you’ve completed the form with your journey and contact details.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You will then be required to self-isolate for 14 days. You must go straight to and stay at the address you provided on the passenger locator form. Your friends or family can collect you from the airport, port or station. You must only use public transport if you have no other option. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you do use public transport, you should wear a face covering, i.e. something that covers your nose and mouth and stay 2 metres apart from other people. Please note that from 15<sup>th</sup> June you will not be allowed on public transport in England if you are not wearing a face covering. You are advised to wear a face covering when using public transport in Scotland.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>
