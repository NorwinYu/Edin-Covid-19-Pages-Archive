Any conversations will be handled with due care and confidentiality, and our staff will work with you to find the appropriate means of safety and redress.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>This could take many forms, but the most likely will be the use of phishing emails. We therefore want to remind all students and staff to be particularly careful of any emails that mention the following:</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>The information below is based on the public health advice issued on 13 March 2020. </span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you or someone in your household has symptoms of Coronavirus (Covid-19) – i.e. a new, continuous cough and/or high temperature - you must self-isolate, i.e. stay at home, for:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>7 days</span></strong><span> from when your symptoms started <strong>if you live alone</strong>, or</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>7 days </span></strong><span>if you are the <strong>first</strong> in your household to develop symptoms, or</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>14 days if you live with others</span></strong><span> and they have symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>If you are the first in your household to develop symptoms:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you need to stay at home for 7 days from the day your symptoms start</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>everyone else in your household needs to stay at home for 14 days (from the day your symptoms start)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>if someone in your household then develops symptoms </span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>they need to self-isolate for 7 days from the onset of their symptoms. This could mean that they have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The 14 day ‘whole household’ isolation does not restart each time a member of the household develops symptoms. So you don’t need to self-isolate beyond 7 days, unless you continue to have a high temperature.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>For example: </span></strong><span>you develop symptoms (day one). You have to stay at home for 7 days. Everyone else has to stay at home for 14 days. If on day 10 someone you live with develops symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days – so in total they will have to self-isolate for 17 days. You don’t need to after day seven. No-one else needs to self-isolate after day 14, unless they too develop symptoms. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>If a member of your household is the first to develop symptoms:</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>they need to stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you and everyone else in your household need to stay at home for 14 days </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>if you then develop symptoms </span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>you need to self-isolate for 7 days from the onset of your symptoms. This could mean that you have to self-isolate for more than the original 14 days.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h5>Hand washing</h5>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can reduce your risk of acquiring and spreading respiratory infections by practising good hygiene:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>avoiding direct hand contact with your eyes, nose and mouth</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>When you arrive at work or home</li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after coughing or sneezing, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>after going to the toilet, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and prior to eating and drinking</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you are unable to use soap and water, hand santiser could be used but you must ensure it is 60% alcohol to be effective and you must wash your hands as soon as you are able to. </li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Although you may now be working from home, please ensure you continue to frequently wash your hands, in particular, if you have been outside and before eating.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand washing posters</h5>

<p>Hand washing posters have been displayed at all sinks around the estates. If you require to, you can download and print off the poster here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/Safety/news/Handwashing_poster.pdf">Hand washing poster</a></li>
</ul>

<h5>Hand sanitisers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>Hand sanitisers will not be provided to buildings and we would not expect local areas to provide these unless there is a need, for example, no hand washing facilities. If supplied, they must be at least 60% alcohol to be effective. Washing hands with soap and water is the most effective means of preventing a spread and using hand sanitisers can give a false sense of cleanliness, in particular if their use is not followed up by proper hand washing.</span></span></span></p>

<h5>Hand driers</h5>

<p><span><span><span>We are aware of a confusion regarding hand driers and whether paper towels are 'safer' to use.  As long as hands are washed correctly, as above, then either paper towels or hand driers can be used.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The Scottish Government </span><span>do not recommend wearing a surgical or other medical grade mask.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>They have however</span><span> released <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-public-use-of-face-coverings/">guidance on face coverings</a> </span><span>which they suggest you wear </span><span>if you are in indoor areas where social distancing measures are difficult to implement, such as shops or on </span><span>public transport.  The face covering, over mouth and nose, could be a scarf or other material. They have also reiterated that this does not replace social distancing and hand and respiratory hygiene measures, but could be used alongside these measures if desired.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Anyone with symptoms must continue to self-isolate for the prescribed time and not go outside, even if wearing any face coverings.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The risk assessments for the current limited range of staff work activities (primarily essential maintenance, student accommodation, Covid-19 research) highlight the need for social distancing and regular hand hygiene measures. Anyone with concerns about social distancing, hand hygiene or other measures within their work area should discuss these with their line manager in the first instance, or your School/Departmental Safety Adviser.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The advice from Health Protection Scotland continues to be that <strong>there is</strong> <strong>no need or requirement</strong> for people to wear a surgical or fitted face mask or gloves in the local community, including the University campus. The University is continuing to concentrate on social distancing and hand and respiratory hygiene as these are still the best way to protect yourself and others.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There are particular reasons why wearing face masks and gloves in non-healthcare settings is not advised. These include the following:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Masks and gloves must be changed frequently and disposed of appropriately – they will become soiled very quickly, for example with sweat build up.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Taking off masks and gloves must be undertaken in a safe manner to avoid cross contamination.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>People tend to touch their face more frequently when wearing masks as they can become uncomfortable or not be correctly fitted – strong advice to avoid infection in the current situation is to not touch your face.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The virus may still exist on gloves, in the same way as it would on hands, and be transferred from gloves onto other hard surfaces. After wearing gloves, people may wash their hands less as they think they are protected, which increases the risk when touching their mouth or eyes.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>Current knowledge on how Covid-19 is spread has been published by Health Protection Scotland and Public Health England in various online guidance documents which are publicity available, such as the<a data-uoe-button="info-sign" href="https://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/web-resources-container/covid-19-guidance-for-non-healthcare-settings/"> ‘COVID-19 - Guidance for Non-Healthcare Settings’</a>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There are two routes by which it is spread; droplets via coughs and sneezes which then reach others standing within 2 meters of them and/or droplets on hard surfaces, such as tables and door handles, from, for example, the hands of someone who has coughed or sneezed and not washed their hands prior to touching this surface. This is why hand and respiratory hygiene, as well as social distancing, is vitally important for limiting the spread of covid-19.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There is currently no evidence to suggest these droplets can become aerosolised and move over long distances in the air, such as within air handling units – droplets which are sneezed or coughed out travel around 2 meters because of the force behind the sneeze or cough.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The University is in constant contact with Health Protection Scotland and we will update any guidance given based on information discussed with the local NHS Health Protection Team.  </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In a situation where a person has suffered illness or accident, the first aiders who arrive on scene are taught to consider not only the condition of the casualty, but also, first and foremost, to ensure their own safety. This includes any hygiene and infection risk from the casualty. First aiders are trained therefore to consider any risk from the casualty from poisons or infectious agents, and to make a decision on the basis of the evidence available at the time. The decision in these circumstances may be to administer CPR by carrying out chest compressions, but not delivering rescue breaths. There is some evidence that adequate ventilation may be achieved if the airway is kept open during such chest compressions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have had several enquiries from University of Edinburgh trained first aiders regarding the situation during the current coronavirus outbreak. The advice is to follow the procedure outlined above, that is:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Assess the situation and check for your own safety.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Approach the casualty if safe to do so, then check the casualty for response by speaking loudly and looking for signs of movement from the chest and abdomen.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Resuscitation Council UK Guidelines 2015 state “If you are untrained or unable to do rescue breaths, give chest compression-only CPR (i.e. continuous compressions at a rate of at least 100–120 min</span><span><span>-1</span></span><span>)”. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Because of the heightened awareness of the possibility that the casualty may have COVID-19, Resuscitation Council UK offers this advice:  </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Recognise cardiac arrest by looking for the absence of signs of life and the absence of normal breathing. Do not listen or feel for breathing by placing your ear and cheek close to the patient’s mouth. If you are in any doubt about confirming cardiac arrest, the default position is to start chest compressions until help arrives. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Make sure an ambulance is on its way. If COVID 19 is suspected, tell them when you call 999. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If there is a perceived risk of infection, rescuers should place a cloth/towel over the casualty’s mouth and nose and attempt compression only CPR and early defibrillation until the ambulance (or advanced care team) arrives. Put hands together in the middle of the chest and push hard and fast.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
