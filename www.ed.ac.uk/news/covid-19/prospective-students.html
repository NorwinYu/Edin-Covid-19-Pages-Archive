  <p><span><span>The University will be open and ready to teach at the start of the new academic year.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We know it is critical that your education is all that you expected it to be and that it is provided in a safe and welcoming environment. We are delighted you want to come to Edinburgh and we want to give you everything you wanted from us, despite the challenges.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We intend to be ready to teach despite any travel restrictions, wherever our students are in the world. As we adapt to this Covid-19 pandemic we are shaping our delivery to ensure that all students - whether here in Edinburgh with us, or elsewhere in the world and joining us a little later in the academic year when circumstances allow - will be fully part of our community.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This may mean we change the format or order of our teaching, but be reassured that our Edinburgh graduate qualities will be as excellent as ever. Changes will vary by degree and individual Schools will contact offer-holders over the coming weeks to confirm how these changes will apply.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Updated 22 May: LanguageCert International ESOL</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have approved the LanguageCert International <abbr title="English for Speakers of Other Languages">ESOL</abbr></span><span> online English test for entry to the University of Edinburgh in 2020.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This is an online English language qualification that you can take at home no matter where you live.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There are two tests:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Reading/Writing/</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Listening</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Speaking</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>These can be taken at the same time, or separately. You must take both tests to meet our entry requirements. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You will need to send us your LanguageCert International ESOL e-certificate and your full scores, so that we can verify your grades.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For more information, and to find out the levels you will require to meet our entry requirements, please see our website:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have approved the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition online test for entry to the University of Edinburgh. This test is available in many countries around the world, and can be taken online from your home.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Entry requirements based on the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition test are exactly the same as the entry requirements for the standard TOEFL iBT test which are listed in your offer.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Updated 22 May: additions to our list of approved universities</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We are continuing to assess universities in non-majority English speaking countries that teach and assess in English to determine whether degrees from these universities can be used to meet our English language requirements. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have recently added a number of institutions in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to our list of approved universities. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If your previous degree was awarded from one of our approved universities within 3.5 years of the start date for your chosen degree at Edinburgh, this can be used to meet our English language entry requirements.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To see if your university is included on our list of approved universities, see our website:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/applying/your-application/entry-requirements/english-requirements/approved-universities"><span>Approved universities</span></a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If your university has recently been added to the list, you should contact the correct college or school admissions office for your degree.  Contact details for your degree can be found on your chosen degree's page in our degree finder:</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Pre-sessional English courses</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have extended the deadline to apply for our Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes programme to 15 May 2020. This course will be delivered online, and has increased capacity.<strong> </strong>For further information, please see the Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes section on this page.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you apply for our Pre-sessional English programme but are not successful in gaining a place, we will also accept students with other BALEAP accredited pre-sessional courses from UK universities for 2020 entry. We will confirm this against our application records.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A full list of accredited universities is provided on the BALEAP website: </span></span><a href="https://www.baleap.org/about-baleap/accredited-institutions"><span><span>Accredited universities</span></span></a><span><span>. <span>Please note that we cannot provide any information or advice about pre-sessional English courses run by other universities.</span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Duolingo Test of English</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Given the exceptional circumstances associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, we have agreed that we will consider acceptance of the Duolingo English Test (DET) as a demonstration of English language competency in specific circumstances.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We will accept DET for entry to our pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes programme from students from mainland China or Iran. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For information about the Pre-sessional programme, and DET entry requirements, please see our website: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We will only consider acceptance of DET for a degree programme when no </span></span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/international/english"><span>accepted English language test</span></a><span><span> is available to the applicant and/or when the applicant does not hold an unconditional offer for a BALEAP-accredited UK pre-sessional English language programme.</span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Currently, this is likely to apply only to applicants from mainland China and Iran. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>DET will not be considered for applicants who already have a place on the University of Edinburgh Pre-sessional programme.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is having a huge impact on the way we live and work worldwide. Here in Edinburgh, our admissions staff are observing the UK-wide lockdown and working remotely. We realise that you may be concerned about any impact this will have on your application to study with us, and we would like to give you some reassurance. </p>

<p>Our admissions staff have access to all our systems and are continuing to process applications as normal. Any academic staff involved in making admissions decisions are also able to participate remotely.</p>

<p>However, this new way of working will take a little time to settle down and it does mean you may see a delay in decision making on your application. Please bear with us as we make these adjustments. We will make decisions as quickly as we can, and we will communicate these with you as normal.</p>
