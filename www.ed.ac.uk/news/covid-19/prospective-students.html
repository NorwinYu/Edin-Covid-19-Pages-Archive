  <p><span><span>The University will be open and ready to teach at the start of the new academic year.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We know it is critical that your education is all that you expected it to be and that it is provided in a safe and welcoming environment. We are delighted you want to come to Edinburgh and we want to give you everything you wanted from us, despite the challenges.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We intend to be ready to teach despite any travel restrictions, wherever our students are in the world. As we adapt to this Covid-19 pandemic we are shaping our delivery to ensure that all students - whether here in Edinburgh with us, or elsewhere in the world and joining us a little later in the academic year when circumstances allow - will be fully part of our community.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This may mean we change the format or order of our teaching, but be reassured that our Edinburgh graduate qualities will be as excellent as ever. Changes will vary by degree and individual Schools will contact offer-holders over the coming weeks to confirm how these changes will apply.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Cancelling a lease with a private landlord or letting agent</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you have entered into a lease (also known as a Private Rented Tenancy) after December 2017, you can terminate your agreement at any point by providing your landlord at least 28 days' notice in writing. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div aria-expanded="false" class="uoe-collapsible-featurebox panel-collapse collapse" id="uoe_featurebox_ea3b345f031261b81ffd0ba0bafbbd995">
<div class="panel-body">
<p><span><span>Our approach to deferrals has always recognised that individual offer-holders may face significant personal challenges or circumstances which mean that they are unable to start their studies as originally planned. While we recognise that all students are likely to have faced some level of disruption from Covid-19, we also acknowledge that some applicants will find their ability to take up their studies particularly affected. This includes:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Students acting as essential workers who may be unable to relinquish their duties before the start of the semester</span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Students affected by <span>personal illness, injury or mental health problems</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Students who have experienced family illness or bereavement</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Students with caring responsibilities or dependents</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Students facing financial hardship or disruption of funding</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Athletes in preparation for rescheduled major sporting events</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>We will prioritise deferral requests from these students.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>While recognising the increased levels of general uncertainty associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, we are also aware of the risks to academic momentum associated with deferral and of the need to treat applicants in different intake years on a fair basis.   </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Consequently, while deferrals will be available, availability will be limited.   This will be particularly true for high demand programmes, to avoid imposing a material disadvantage on 2021 applicants by a reduction in the range of places available to them.  </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Undergraduate deferral requests</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Deferral requests for undergraduate degrees which are received by 5.00pm on 30 June 2020 will receive a decision by 6 July 2020. If a deferral request is unsuccessful, the offer for 2020 entry will remain valid. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We expect to make most of our deferral decisions by 6 July, but we may be able to consider a limited number of additional requests received over the summer and intend to make these decisions after 20<sup>th</sup> August.  </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If we receive more requests for deferred places than we are able to approve, we will consider any specific information on personal extenuating circumstances provided by students on an individual basis. Otherwise, we will prioritise those who are best qualified for their programme, taking account of any contextual considerations.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Unfortunately due to UCAS regulations we are only able to defer a place where all offer conditions have been met by 31 August 2020. If your results are expected after this date then we will honour your offer for 2020 entry but we will not be able to defer the place.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Postgraduate taught deferral requests</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Decisions on deferral requests will begin to be made from late June 2020. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>It is expected that some deferral decisions for each programme will be made each month until the 31 August.  Unsuccessful deferral requests will be rolled forward to the next decision point.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If we receive more requests for deferred places than we are able to approve, we will consider any specific mitigating information provided by students on an individual basis. Otherwise, we will prioritise those students who are best qualified for their programme, taking account of any contextual considerations.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Where a deposit is required, a student must have paid their deposit in order to have their offer deferred. The deposit will roll forward with the deferred offer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Recognising the rapidly evolving impact of Covid-19, we have taken the difficult decision to <strong>cancel on-campus offer holder events</strong>.  Your College admissions team will be in touch with details of online content you can view to get to know Edinburgh, the University and information on specific subject areas and programmes.   </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have also decided to <strong><span>cancel the Undergraduate Open Day scheduled for 15 June</span></strong> this year.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The two undergraduate Open Days scheduled for 26 September and 10 October 2020 are currently still planned to go ahead, and this webpage will be updated with the latest guidance. We are also working to develop an online alternative for prospective students thinking about starting university in 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Updated 22 May: LanguageCert International ESOL</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have approved the LanguageCert International <abbr title="English for Speakers of Other Languages">ESOL</abbr></span><span> online English test for entry to the University of Edinburgh in 2020.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This is an online English language qualification that you can take at home no matter where you live.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>There are two tests:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Reading/Writing/</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Listening</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Speaking</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>These can be taken at the same time, or separately. You must take both tests to meet our entry requirements. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>You will need to send us your LanguageCert International ESOL e-certificate and your full scores, so that we can verify your grades.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For more information, and to find out the levels you will require to meet our entry requirements, please see our website:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have approved the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition online test for entry to the University of Edinburgh. This test is available in many countries around the world, and can be taken online from your home.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Entry requirements based on the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition test are exactly the same as the entry requirements for the standard TOEFL iBT test which are listed in your offer.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span>Postgraduate only </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Updated 22 May: additions to our list of approved universities</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We are continuing to assess universities in non-majority English speaking countries that teach and assess in English to determine whether degrees from these universities can be used to meet our English language requirements. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>We have recently added a number of institutions in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe to our list of approved universities. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If your previous degree was awarded from one of our approved universities within 3.5 years of the start date for your chosen degree at Edinburgh, this can be used to meet our English language entry requirements.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To see if your university is included on our list of approved universities, see our website:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/applying/your-application/entry-requirements/english-requirements/approved-universities"><span>Approved universities</span></a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If your university has recently been added to the list, you should contact the correct college or school admissions office for your degree.  Contact details for your degree can be found on your chosen degree's page in our degree finder:</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Pre-sessional English courses</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We have extended the deadline to apply for our Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes programme to 15 May 2020. This course will be delivered online, and has increased capacity.<strong> </strong>For further information, please see the Pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes section on this page.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you apply for our Pre-sessional English programme but are not successful in gaining a place, we will also accept students with other BALEAP accredited pre-sessional courses from UK universities for 2020 entry. We will confirm this against our application records.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A full list of accredited universities is provided on the BALEAP website: </span></span><a href="https://www.baleap.org/about-baleap/accredited-institutions"><span><span>Accredited universities</span></span></a><span><span>. <span>Please note that we cannot provide any information or advice about pre-sessional English courses run by other universities.</span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Students from mainland China and Iran</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong>Is the Duolingo English Test accepted?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We will only accept the Duolingo English Test (DET) for entry to a degree programme where no other accepted English language test is available to you.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Currently this is likely to apply to students from China and Iran only.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We cannot accept Duolingo English Test for entry to a postgraduate degree if you already hold an unconditional offer for our Pre-Sessional English programme or for an alternative BALEAP-accredited UK pre-sessional English language course.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>For more information, please visit our Duolingo pages for undergraduate or postgraduate entry.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We are also aware that English language test centres are closed in many countries. You may be concerned about being unable to take your English language test, or unable to use your school qualifications, to meet the English language conditions of your offer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is important for the success of your studies in Edinburgh that you can demonstrate good English language skills. If you come from outside the EU and you need a visa to study here, the UK government may also set an English language requirement as a condition of your visa. While we hope test centres will reopen soon in your country, we will continue to review other options and will keep you informed if we make any changes to accepted English language tests. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
